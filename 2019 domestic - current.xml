                    <para>This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering <link

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">domestic buildings</link>. These Technical
                        Handbooks have been issued by Scottish Ministers for the purpose of
                        providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the
                        provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance
                        with Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has
                        eight sections. Section 0, this section, is identical in both Handbooks. It
                        covers general issues and sets out how and when the regulations apply to
                            <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> and
                            <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>.</para>
                    <para>The 2013 Edition of the Handbooks are being published electronically and
                        are available free on the Scottish Government, Building Standards Division
                        website.</para>
                    <para>Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the
                        regulations, and there are different sets for <link
                            linkend="domestic_building" xreflabel="definedTerm">domestic
                            buildings</link> and non-<link linkend="domestic_building"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">domestic buildings</link>. The seven sections
                        each cover a number of related standards. They are:</para>
                    <para>Section 1 Structure</para>
                    <para>Section 2 Fire</para>

                    <para>Section 5 Noise</para>
                    <para>Section 6 Energy</para>
                    <para>Section 7 Sustainability</para>
                    <para>Each of the seven sections consists of an introduction and then general
                        guidance on the standards within the section. This is followed be each
                        standard which has specific introductory information and guidance on how to
                        comply with the standard. At the of the Handbook, after Section 7, there are
                        the following two sections:</para>
                    <para>Appendix A: Defined terms.</para>
                    <para>Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.</para>
                    
                    <para>The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, published
                        separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures
                        Regulations 2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Crown <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> has also
                        been produced.</para>

                    <title>0.1.2 The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004</title>
                    <para>This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in
                        the Building (Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found
                        in schedule 5 to regulation 9, and are in the form of ‘expanded functional
                        standards’. That is, the standards describe the functions a <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> should
                        perform, such as ‘providing resistance to the spread of fire’.</para>
                    <para>The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are
                        subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the
                        regulations, so far as it relates to technical specifications, is also
                        scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC checks with all the
                        other countries that have adopted the <link
                            linkend="construction_products_directive" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >Construction Products Regulations</link> (CPR) to ensure that no
                        barriers to trade in <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >construction</link> products are created, either directly or indirectly
                        by the way products are described.</para>
                    <para>To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and <link
                            linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link> methods
                        must be described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these
                        exist. As there is a rolling programme of change to these National and
                        European Standards, which includes conversion to, and the further provision
                        of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks have been designed to be readily
                        updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of specific European and
                        British standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section concerned.
                        There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks
                        provided in Appendix B.</para>
                    <para>The arrangement of Sections 1 - 7 within the Handbooks relates directly to
                        the Basic Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which
                            <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link>
                        <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link> are expected to
                        satisfy when they have been properly designed and <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">built</link>.  The arrangement is as

                    <title>0.1.3 The building standards system</title>
                    <para>The building regulations are enforced through the building standards
                        system that is established by the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act sets
                        out the enabling powers that allow Scottish Ministers to make, not only the
                        building regulations, but also procedural regulations, fees regulations and
                        the other supporting legislation needed to operate the system. The system is
                        designed to ensure that new <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> and <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link> achieve the objectives of <link
                            linkend="the_act" xreflabel="definedTerm">the Act</link> in terms of
                        health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel and power, and
                        sustainable development.</para>
                    <para>The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained
                        in detail in the guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty
                        to comply with the building regulations lies with the owner, or in some
                        cases the client, for the <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >work</link>. Before <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >work</link> begins a building warrant must be obtained.</para>
                    <para>For some simpler <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>
                        a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but the
                        regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply.
                        The role of issuing warrants and accepting completion certificates rests
                        with verifiers, enforcement is by local authorities, and the system is
                        overseen and updated by the Building Standards Division (BSD). BSD forms
                        part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is responsible
                        to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance
                        to the procedural regulations.</para>
                    <para>The building standards system is pre-emptive, ensuring so far as possible
                        that the proposed <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>
                        will comply with the regulations. It recognises that proposals can change
                        during <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                        >construction</link>, so there are requirements for amendments to the
                        proposals to be agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must
                        certify that the <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">works</link>
                        have been <link linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >constructed</link> in accordance with the building warrant and the
                        building regulations. The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure
                        the completion certificate is accurate before accepting the certificate.
                        Usually an inspection of the <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >works</link> will be made, and on most projects some inspection of
                            <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> in progress
                        will also have been carried out. However verifiers cannot inspect all
                        materials and <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> on
                        every <link linkend="building_site" xreflabel="definedTerm">building
                            site</link>. It is the client that should put in place the contractual
                        and practical arrangements needed to assure themselves that the desired
                        quality of <link linkend="work" xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> has been
                        achieved.</para>

                    <title>0.1.4 Status of Technical Handbooks</title>
                    <para>The regulations are mandatory, but the choice of how to comply lies with
                        the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> owner.
                        This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the
                        Building Standards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance
                        with respect to the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in
                        full then this should be accepted by the verifier as indicating that the
                        building regulations have been complied with. However it is quite acceptable
                        to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the
                        regulations.</para>
                    <para>Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person
                        liable to civil or criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the
                        guidance may be relied on in any proceedings as tending to negative
                        liability for an alleged contravention of the building regulations.</para>
                    <para>Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be
                        the normal way of complying with the building regulations. However, a
                        designer may put forward other ways of meeting the regulations, in the form
                        of alternative solutions.</para>
                    <para>There are a further three guidance documents that have the same standing
                        as the Technical Handbooks. Scottish Ministers have issued these under
                        Section 4(1) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. These are:</para>

                    <title>0.1.5 Alternative solutions</title>
                    <para>The use of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance,
                        provides a flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative
                        solutions is assisted by the expansion of the functional standards
                        previously used in the building standards regulations to clarify the
                        necessary properties of each <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. The need for a formal
                        relaxation of standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given
                        solutions is no longer mandatory. The professional judgement of the
                        verifier, assisted by guidance on questions referred to Scottish Ministers,
                        through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is
                        met.</para>
                    <para>In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have
                        regard to the details of this guidance. Where performance standards or
                        policy statements are given, every part of the solution is expected to meet
                        them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear suitable may not be
                        acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in relation
                        to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the ‘Approved Documents’
                        (ADs), are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended
                        are not the same. Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of
                        fire size and the design of <link linkend="compartment"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">compartmentation</link> which means that <link
                            linkend="construct" xreflabel="definedTerm">constructions</link> meeting
                        the AD on fire safety may not be acceptable. This will vary in time as both
                        ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks are updated. Solutions based on
                        other documents, such as British or European Standards, will have to be
                        carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an
                        appropriate manner.</para>

                        appropriate parts from each Technical Handbook will need to be used to
                        ensure the standards are complied with in full, for example a caretakers

                        <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. However,
                        communal <link linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">rooms</link> or other
                        areas in a block of <link linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        considered using the domestic guidance. Examples of this might be a <link
                            linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">room</link> used as an <link

                        also a general principle that where a <link linkend="buildings"

                        electronic form and available free of charge on the Building Standards

                        are set in the building regulations and can only be changed with
                        Parliamentary approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will
                        be replaced more regularly than the standards themselves.  </para>

                        provides an introduction to the building standards system. Sub-section 0.2
                        covers regulations 1 and 2 which are the citation, commencement and
                        interpretation. Sub-sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover the significant technical
                        regulations with each sub-section setting out and discussing the regulation
                        with the same number (sub-section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.).
                        Regulation 16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by
                        Scottish Ministers. These are the regulations on citation and commencement,
                        interpretation, exempted buildings, <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> not requiring a warrant and the
                        methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduced in 2007 to help with
                        the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</para>

                        compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                        approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                        account of the need to co-ordinate the <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> of various designers and specialist
                        contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under
                        the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills
                        and experience required to certify compliance for the <link linkend="work"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">work</link> covered by the scope of the scheme.

                        is the intention that the standards achieved in the <link linkend="convert"

                        <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> should be
                        broadly similar to those achieved by entirely new <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link>. Schedule 6 to regulation 12
                        guides the verifier as to where discretion is expected to be necessary. It
                        identifies those standards where it is not expected to be <link

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> fully comply. However for these
                        standards improvement of the existing <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> is expected where it is <link

                        now have to be improved even if meeting the full standard is not practically
                        achievable. Guidance on what is normally <link

                    <para>Regulation 8 applies to all building work, and requires that materials,
                        fittings and components used in the construction of buildings should be
                        suitable for their purpose, correctly used or applied, and sufficiently
                        durable, taking account of normal maintenance practices, to meet the
                        requirements of these regulations. For example, external timber cladding for
                        low-rise <link linkend="buildings">buildings</link> that is readily
                        accessible and replaceable need not be as durable as that which is to be
                        used at a higher level on medium-rise <link linkend="buildings"
                            >buildings</link>. </para>
                    <para>It also implements the European Regulation 305/2011/EU Construction
                        Products Regulation (CPR), in force on 1 July 2013 that replaces the current
                        Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC). This Regulation requires that
                        products covered by a harmonised European product standard or conforming to
                        a European Technical Assessment should normally have CE marking.</para>
                    <para>The intention of the guidance below is to provide adequate flexibility to
                        accommodate new techniques as well as proven traditional practices. This
                        guidance ensures acceptance of products which satisfy the basic works
                        requirements of the CPR to avoid barriers to trade. For example, products
                        bearing a CE mark (European Mark of Conformity) must be accepted as meeting
                        regulation requirements where the declaration of performance satisfies the
                        requirement and the product is being correctly used.   </para>
                    <para>Sections 1 - 7 of the Technical Handbooks are arranged to equate with the
                        7 basic works requirements of the CPR. This should aid assessment of
                        products against the regulation requirements. There may however be other
                        Directives applicable to certain products or <link linkend="construct"
                            >constructions</link>. </para>
                    <para>A verifier may only reject CE marked products if the declaration of
                        performance does not meet the regulation requirement or the products are
                        being incorrectly used. If the verifier rejects a product the relevant
                        trading standards officer should be notified. This is a requirement of the
                        CPR, and will enable the UK government, where necessary, to notify the
                        European Commission.</para>
                    <para>It should be noted that CE marking alone does not show compliance with the
                        building regulations, as the CE mark may be showing compliance with other
                        Directives or Regulations applicable to certain products or constructions.
                         For example, a self contained smoke alarm, manufactured in accordance with
                        the Electro Magnetic Compatibility Directive should be accepted as
                        satisfying requirements only insofar as they relate to prevention of
                        electromagnetic disturbances by, and prevention against disturbances to,
                        such smoke alarms.   </para>

                                <para>The CPR requires that construction products on the EU market
                                    covered by a harmonised European product standard should
                                    normally have CE marking. In addition, manufacturers of products
                                    not covered by a harmonised standard can choose to affix CE
                                    marking to their products by obtaining a European Technical

                        For example, care should be taken where alternative numerical values are
                        placed on factors of safety as this may have a detrimental effect on the

                    <para>The British Standards Institution (BSI) agreement with the European
                        Committee for Standardisation (CEN) obliges it to withdraw UK national

                        of application has been produced. Withdrawal of a standard implies that
                        while documents will still be available there will be no support or
                        five-year review by a BSI committee to consider the currency of the standard
                        and to decide whether it should be confirmed, revised or withdrawn. BSI, in
                        line with this commitment, will be 31 March 2010 replace the British
                        Standards relating to loading and structural design with the European
                        Standards and associated National Annexes listed in Sections 1.1.2 and 1.1.3

                    <para>Whilst other guidance documents or international standards, including
                        withdrawn national standards might be used in alternative approaches to
                        satisfy building regulations, designers, verifiers, or in the case of
                        certified projects, the approved certifiers of design (<link

                        for a specific project. Care should be exercised, particularly with
                        withdrawn standards, in relation to wind and snow loadings (actions) where
                        the effects of climate change may render these unsafe.</para>
                    <para>Where alternative approaches use design methods or codes other than those
                        listed in this guidance then these must be used within the context of the
                        assumptions set out in Section 1.1.3. Designs must be checked in order to
                        deliver similar levels of design reliability.</para>

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">constructed</link> in such a way that the risk
                        of fire is reduced and, if a fire does occur, there are measures in place to
                        restrict the growth of fire and smoke to enable the occupants to escape
                        safely and fire-fighters to deal with fire safely and effectively.</para>
                    <para>There are almost 5000 reported fires  in <link linkend="dwelling"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">dwellings</link> (e.g. <link linkend="house"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">houses</link>, <link linkend="flat"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">flats</link> and <link linkend="maisonette"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">maisonettes</link>) every year in Scotland.
                        Fires can have a devastating effect on the lives of people and results in
                        around 40 deaths and 900 injuries each year. The most common cause of
                        accidental fires in <link linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >dwellings</link> involved cooking appliances (62%), electrical supply
                        or electrical lighting (14%), combustibles ignited due to being too close to
                        candles or other heat source (9%), the remaining 15% is accounted for by the
                        careless disposal of cigarettes and matches and other domestic appliances.
                        Evidence also shows that the consumption of alcohol and/or smoking are
                        contributory factors which increases the risk of an accidental fire
                        occurring. Occupants who are alone at the time of the fire and are in the
                            <link linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">room</link> of fire origin,
                        are more likely to suffer injury (e.g. burns and smoke inhalation) or even
                        death in some cases.</para>
                    <para>It is impossible to eliminate the risks from fire altogether and the
                        prevention of deliberate or accidental fires caused by the actions of
                        occupants within a <link linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >dwelling</link> are outside the scope of building standards. For advice
                        on best practice relating to fire safety in the home, visit the Scottish
                        Fire and Rescue Service website <link

                        fire safety team at your local fire station. Although beyond the scope of
                        this guidance, the adoption of good fire safety practices should be
                        encouraged to reduce the risk of fire occurring in the first place. Fire
                        prevention will not only save lives but will protect property and reduce
                        environmental pollution.</para>
                    <para>The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together

                    <para>The rules of measurement in Section 0 of the Technical Handbook may not be
                        appropriate for the guidance in Section 2 Fire. For example, to establish
                        the height of the topmost storey for fire and rescue service facilities, the
                        height should be measured from the fire and rescue service access level and
                        not necessarily the lowest ground level. Therefore, methods of measurement
                        unique to fire are described within the guidance under each of the relevant
                        standards.</para>

                            standards</emphasis> - the guidance contained within this Technical
                        Handbook indicates one or sometimes more than one means of complying with
                        the mandatory building standards 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it
                        is envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing
                        that compliance with the building standards has been achieved. </para>
                    <para>However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the
                        guidance it cannot cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or
                        new methods of construction. In such cases the designer or engineer will be
                        required to show, by alternative means, that compliance with the building
                        standards will be achieved in the completed building. For example, where the
                        elements of structure are engineered timber (including cross laminated
                        timber), the structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and
                        fully developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on
                        intervention from the fire and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible
                        elements of structure may require to be provided to protect the structure
                        against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. Where
                        encapsulation (i.e. both physically and in terms of the period of fire
                        resistance duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible
                        material against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire, the
                        structural fire engineer should consider the additional contribution of the
                        exposed combustible material to the fire load density including an
                        assessment of the structural stability of the building due to both potential
                        delamination and failure of the fixings at elevated temperatures.</para>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Fire safety engineering</emphasis> - it is
                        reasonable to demonstrate compliance with the functional standards by
                        alternative means and in such cases, the fire engineer, the building
                        standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early
                        in the design process.</para>
                    <para>Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a
                        satisfactory level of fire safety in some large and complex <link

                        innovative or new methods of construction are used. In such cases a holistic
                        approach is desirable from first principles rather than following, in part
                        or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical Handbooks. In such cases
                        the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be
                        consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.</para>
                    <para>For many projects it is likely that designers will follow the guidance in
                        the Technical Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be
                        necessary. In its simplest form the QDR team may define the acceptance
                        criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.</para>
                    <para>However, it is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged
                        relatively late in the design process to resolve fire safety issues raised
                        during the verification or, in extreme cases, the construction process. This
                        is unhelpful as fire engineers are often commissioned to resolve specific
                        issues where the design does not follow the guidance rather than assessing
                        the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise against
                        unrealistic worse case scenarios of a “code compliant” design to justify
                        deviations. This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that
                        the safety goals are well defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of
                        safety. The objective of a comparative study should be to demonstrate that
                        the building design, as a whole, presents no greater risk to the occupants
                        than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the Technical
                        Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of
                        Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks would
                        not merit such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there
                        may be instances where small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a
                        “whole building” fire engineered design and inevitably involves a degree of
                        negotiation without the need for detailed analysis.</para>
                    
                        <para>Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the
                        appointment of a fire engineer. Reference could be made to ‘A simplified
                        approach to alternative fire safety strategies’ Scottish Government (2010),

                            and designers and verifiers should be aware of the importance of the
                            design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an
                            assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure that the
                            fire safety objectives have been met.</para>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Responsible person</emphasis> - it is important that

                        to be maintained and tested over the life time of the <link

                        will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the

                        the lifetime of the <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised.
                        For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety
                        risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as
                        amended.</para>
                    <para>Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations
                        and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety

                            >building</link>, structure or installation. In this regard the fire
                        safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore
                        fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard,
                        assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety
                        strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The ‘tools’
                        that support fire engineering can include calculation methods which are used
                        to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions are
                        maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust fan in
                        a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the smoke
                        layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a stand-by
                        fan.</para>
                    <para>It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field
                        and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving
                        problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified

                        For example, it may be appropriate to consider fire safety equipment such as
                        portable fire suppression and automatic cut-off devices for cookers
                        depending on the risk identified.</para>

                        person) is the best way to protect residents from the risk of fire.</para>

                        risk from fires starting beyond their boundaries. The area of greatest
                        vulnerability is the roof and there may be a risk of ignition or penetration
                        by burning brands, flames or heat. The degree of protection for roof
                        coverings is dependent upon the distance to the <link linkend="boundary"

                        <para>A roof covering consists of one or more layer of material such as

                        the whole of the roof structure. Solar roof panels should be regarded as
                        forming part of the roof covering and as such should be able to resist
                        ignition from an external source. Most solar panels are <link

                        ability to inhibit fire spread can be determined by the thickness of glass
                        which makes up the panel (see table to annex 2.C).</para>
                    <para>A roof covering or roof light which forms part of an internal ceiling

                        out. Forced air can be used to maintain a positive pressure in the <link

                        produces an air flow through gaps around doors preventing the smoke from
                        entering. The system design should take account of likely pressure reduction
                        when occupants open doors to escape or when fire-fighters open doors to
                        access the fire. The system should be balanced to ensure that the forces
                        required to open doors are not greater than those specified in Section 4

                    <para>Over 90% of Scottish fire deaths occur in the <link linkend="dwelling"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">dwelling</link> of fire origin.  Asphyxiation
                        caused by smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death. If there is an
                        outbreak of fire within a <link linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >dwelling</link>, early detection and warning to the occupants can play
                        a vital role in increasing their chances of escape. This is particularly
                        important as the occupants may well be asleep and are more likely to react
                        slower.</para>
                    <para>Most fires in <link linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >dwellings</link> are accidental and statistics show that the main
                        sources of ignition are: Cooking appliances, smoking related, candles,
                        electrical supply and other domestic appliances.</para>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Occupant characteristics</emphasis> - in the 4 years
                        2014-2015 to 2017-2018 where fatalities were recorded, on average 30% of
                        fires started in the living room, 17% in bedrooms, and 15% in the kitchen.
                        This means that a significant number of fire related deaths, 62% or 107
                        deaths over the 4 year period, occurred from fires starting in these rooms.
                        It is therefore important that the outbreak of fire in living rooms and
                        kitchens is detected quickly and the alarm raised as early as possible
                        during the early stages of fire growth.</para>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Tolerable Standards</emphasis> - in January 2019
                        amendments to the tolerable standards introduced a requirement for all <link

                        with heat and smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detection by February 2021.
                        Guidance in support of the tolerable standards calls for interlinked heat
                        and smoke detection to be sited as per the guidance contained in this
                        technical handbook, with the allowance that the installation may be powered
                        by sealed for life battery units. However, where an existing partial or full
                        mains operated heat and smoke detection system is being altered it would
                        normally be expected to replace mains wired devices with mains wired
                        units.</para>

                        result in the greatest number of fatalities and injuries in Scotland each

                        service personnel, a paved (or equivalent) footpath at least 900mm wide (see
                        also Section 4 Safety) should be provided to the normal entrances, of a

                    <para>In addition, where vehicle access is not possible to within 18m of the dry
                        riser inlets (see clause 2.12.1), a footpath should also be provided to the
                        riser inlets. This will allow the fire and rescue service to deploy portable
                        pumps to relay water supplies to where the water is needed. Whilst this
                        method of water distribution is quite common, it should be avoided for new
                        developments because of the time delay in supplying water to the
                        fire-fighters.</para>
                    <para>Every elevation which is provided with vehicle or pedestrian access for

                        implement ‘defensive’ fire-fighting tactics to control the spread of fire.
                        In cases where a large fire develops, numerous fire-fighting teams may be

                        own flat or maisonette. However, circumstances may arise in which
                        fire-fighters consider it necessary to evacuate residents from a small
                        number of other flats and, on very rare occasions, the entire building. An

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> in relation to the fire station

                        risks to fire and rescue service personnel. Fire and smoke can suddenly

                        reverse air flows. For example, the wind direction and velocity (which
                        increases with height) could have a significant impact when fire-fighters
                        open the door to the dwelling of fire origin. Similarly, limited ventilation
                        available in a <link linkend="basement_storey" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >basement storey</link> can lead to heat and smoke build up that is
                        released through the opening the fire-fighters are using as an entry

                        should complement fire-fighting and rescue capability. The 7.5m storey
                        height above the ground is historically linked to the height at which fire
                        and rescue service personnel can rescue occupants using the standard 13.5m
                        portable ladder. Whilst this practice is no longer common, for health and
                        safety reasons, fire fighters continue to carry out external rescues as a
                        last resort and <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link> design should recognise this.</para>
                    <para>The 18m storey height above the ground is also historically linked with
                        the reach capability of fire and rescue service equipment such as wheeled
                        escape ladders (now obsolete). The general intent is that <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> with a
                        storey at a height of more than 18m above the access level, cannot be easily
                        reached by fire and rescue service equipment and personnel. Therefore, at
                        least 1 fire-fighting shaft (fire-fighting stair, fire-fighting lobby, fire
                        mains and in some cases a fire-fighting lift) is provided within the <link

                    <para>In addition, fire-fighters cannot apply water jets from fire hoses onto

                    <para>The fire and rescue service facilities recommended in the table should be

                        rescue service appliances.</para>
                    <para>A square or rectangular sign, bearing the words “Evacuation System: For
                        Fire and Rescue Services Use Only”, should be fixed to the door of the
                        cabinet. The wording should comprise white Sans Serif text, on a red
                        background, with a lower case letter height of at least 10mm. The sign
                        should incorporate the red flames pictogram specified for fire-fighting
                        equipment in BS 5499-10. The sign should be of metal construction and should
                        be fixed to the door of the cabinet by at least four security screws.</para>
                    <para>The control equipment should be simple to operate and should not require
                        use of a password, key switch or keypad. Switches should be provided to
                        enable evacuation of any single floor by use of a single switch. The
                        switches should be located in a vertical column on the control equipment,
                        mirroring the floors of the building, with the switch for the topmost floor
                        at the top of the column, and switches for further floors descending floor
                        by floor, with the switch for the lowest floor at the bottom of the column.
                        Switches should be of the biased toggle type. In large blocks of flats,
                        separate switches, sited horizontally, may be provided to enable evacuation
                        of, for example, one wing of any floor, separately from other areas of that
                        floor. A red LED, associated with each switch, should be used to indicate
                        that operation of sounders has been initiated.</para>
                    <para>Two further biased “push to make” switches should be provided. One of
                        these should cause the evacuation signal to sound throughout all dwellings
                        in the building. The legend “Evacuate Whole Building” should be used to show
                        the function of the switch. The second switch should silence all sounders in
                        the building and should bear the legend “Silence all Sounders”.</para>
                    <para>Facilities not readily available or visible to the fire and rescue service
                        (e.g. located behind a locked door within the control panel, bearing the
                        words “Controls for Maintenance Use Only” or similar) should be provided to
                        enable operation of the sounder(s) within any single flat or maisonette,
                        independently of sounders in other dwellings. This is to enable testing of
                        the sounder(s) within each flat during routine maintenance.</para>
                    <para>The control equipment should, other than in respect of the functions and
                        indications, conform to the requirements of BS EN 54-2.</para>
                    <para>Within each flat, at least one fire alarm sounder, conforming to the
                        requirements of BS EN 3, should be provided. Normally, only one sounder is
                        likely to be necessary, but the sound pressure level of the alarm signal at
                        each open bedroom doorway should be at least 85 dB(A). Sound pressure level
                        within other rooms should be at least 60 dB(A).</para>
                    <para>All wiring, including the wiring of power supplies, should comprise cables
                        of enhanced fire resistance, as defined in sub-clause 26.2e) of BS 5839-1:
                        2017. An open or short circuit on the wiring of the sounder(s) in any flat
                        should not disable any sounder in any other flat. </para>
                    <para>The system may use radio transmission for communication between the
                        control equipment and the sounders, in which case the system should conform
                        to the recommendations of Clause 27 of BS 5839-1: 2017. Additionally, all
                        batteries used within fire alarm sounders should be capable of operating the
                        sounders correctly for at least five years before warning of impending
                        failure of the battery is given at the control equipment, taking into
                        account annual operation of the sounders for at least 30 minutes on one
                        occasion, plus a further 10 minutes each year.</para>
                    <para>Mains power for the system should conform to the recommendations of
                        sub-clauses 25.2 and 25.3 of BS 5839-1: 2017. Standby power supplies should
                        comply with the recommendations of sub-clause 25.4 of BS 5839-1: 2017,
                        except that the capacity of standby batteries should be sufficient to
                        maintain the system in the quiescent mode for at least 72 hours, after which
                        sufficient capacity should remain to operate all fire alarm sounders for at
                        least 30 minutes. A green indicator should be provided to indicate the
                        supply of power to the system (from either the mains supply or the standby
                        batteries). A general fault indicator and audible sounder within the control
                        equipment should be provided to indicate any fault on the system that can be
                        detected by the system. Such faults include power supply failures and faults
                        on sounder circuits.</para>
                    <para>The system should be designed, installed, and commissioned in accordance

                    <para>Automatic fire suppression systems installed in domestic premises are
                        primarily designed for life safety purposes. Successful activation can
                        provide occupants, including vulnerable occupants, with additional time to
                        escape following the outbreak of fire. The added benefit of automatic fire
                        suppression in <link linkend="domestic_building" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >domestic buildings</link> means that the damage and disruption caused
                        by fire is greatly reduced.</para>
              
                        <para>Automatic suppression systems react to heat therefore, the greatest
                        protection is afforded to those occupants outwith the <link linkend="room"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">room</link> of fire origin. Automatic
                        suppression may provide some benefit to occupants in the <link
                            linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">room</link> of fire origin where
                        for example the fire growth is fast and the temperatures allow the sprinkler
                        system (normally 1 or 2 heads) to open early in the development phase of the
                        fire. The spray pattern delivered from the sprinkler heads should control
                        fire spread. Whilst the effect of sprinkler spray will increase the smoke
                        volume and could obscure <link linkend="exit" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >exits</link>, smoke temperatures and toxicity will be greatly reduced.
                        In some cases, the fire might be extinguished if the fire is not shielded
                        from the sprinkler spray.</para>

                        appropriate water supply. Therefore, designers need to discuss with Scottish
                        Water what supply is likely to be available and what pressure can be
                        expected. It is recognised that pressures will vary during the day, over the
                        year and perhaps in future years. Therefore it is imperative that the system
                        is designed on the basis of what the minimum pressure and flow is likely to
                        be. If there is any doubt, a tank and pump arrangement should be
                        used.</para>

                    <para>For all construction products, the consideration is of a fire, initiated
                        in a room, which can grow and eventually reach flashover. This scenario
                        includes three fire situations corresponding to three stages in the
                        development of a fire:</para>

                                the room, creating a heat flux on adjacent surfaces. For floorings,
                                fire is seen to grow in the room of origin, creating a heat flux on
                                the floorings in an adjacent room or corridor, through a door

                        It has therefore been necessary to use the reaction to fire
                        classification system in BS EN 13501-1: 2018 for external wall

                    <para>The national test for roof coverings is BS 476: Part 3: 2012 which
                        measures the capability of a roof to resist penetration from fire and flame

                    <para>BS 476: Part 3: 2012 sets out a classification system based on external
                        penetration and flame spread as set out in the following table. The first
                        letter of the designation indicates fire penetration performance i.e. the
                        time at which any glowing or flaming [other than that from the gas pilot
                        flame] appears on the underside of the specimen. The second letter of the
                        designation indicates flame spread performance. The addition of the suffix
                        ‘X’ indicates dripping from the underside of the specimen, any mechanical
                        failure or development of holes in the specimen. The angle of the specimen
                        in the test is designated by the prefix ’S’ [slope] or ‘F’ [flat].</para>

                    <para>Water, air and soil are intricately linked and all can be affected by
                        various forms of pollution that affect our environment. Other issues such as
                        condensation have been a constant threat to people and <link
                            linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> for many
                        years.</para>
                    <para>Industrial change and demographic shift during the 19th and 20th centuries
                        resulted in large-scale re-organisation of our villages, towns and cities.
                        Industries moved out or disappeared altogether leaving large, 'brownfield',
                        gaps in our landscape. At the same time, changes in heating methods and the
                        advent of the consumer society, have had a significant effect on the type
                        and volume of refuse it has been necessary to dispose of to landfill.
                        Inevitably, these changes have left behind a legacy of land contamination
                        that in some cases, may be harmful. The Scottish Government encourages the
                        use of previously developed land (brownfield) and local authorities may wish
                        to promote brownfield land in preference to greenfield land. Some of this
                        land will be contaminated and will need to be made safe.</para>
                    <para>Climate is controlled by the long-term balance of energy of the Earth and
                        its atmosphere. Natural events cause changes in climate but human activities
                        can also change the climate. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the
                        atmosphere due to human activities will change the climate by enhancing the
                        natural greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in the Earth's average
                        surface temperature resulting in heavier rainfall.</para>
                    <para>Indoor air quality complaints are frequently associated with comfort
                        issues: high or low temperatures, draughts, high or low humidity or poor
                        lighting. However the incidence of real indoor pollution should not be
                        ignored, it is surprisingly common. The <link linkend="construct"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">construction</link> quality of <link
                            linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm">dwellings</link> is improving
                        with a resulting reduction of adventitious air infiltration producing fewer
                        air changes. Inadequate ventilation, inefficient filtration and poor hygiene
                        all contribute to poor indoor air quality.</para>
                    <para>Carbon monoxide (CO) gas has no smell, taste or colour and it kills dozens
                        of people in their homes every year. Many more suffer debilitating illnesses
                        often without anybody realising that they are being poisoned. CO gas is
                        produced by combustion appliances such as fires, boilers and water heaters.
                        Any appliance that burns solid fuel, gas or oil and that does not have a
                        room-sealed balanced flue so that it is sealed off from the <link
                            linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">room</link>, is capable of
                        poisoning you if it is not properly installed, maintained and serviced. The
                        highest incidence of CO poisoning occurs in <link

                    <para>Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in
                        Scotland that are investigated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency
                        (SEPA). That means around 500 to 600 pollution incidents a year with about
                        10 to 12% being serious. It is an offence to cause pollution and courts now
                        impose heavy fines. Although domestic pollution is low compared with
                        commercial and industrial <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >buildings</link>, it is important to ensure standards are not
                        lowered.</para>

                        considered to prevent environmental pollution and uncontrollable run-off
                        during periods of heavy rainfall leading to flooding. The incorporation of
                        water conservation measures in <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> can reduce pressure on precious
                        water resources by recycling water from certain types of appliance.
                        Recycling can also reduce the reliance on mains water and limit the amount
                        of water discharged thus alleviating the risk of flooding. The inclusion of
                        ‘green roofs’ into <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                        <para>Land contamination is an unwanted legacy of Britain’s long industrial
                        history. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990<emphasis
                            role="bold"> </emphasis>(inserted by Section 57 of the Environment Act
                        1995) was introduced to enable the identification and remediation of
                        contaminated land from which contamination currently represents an
                        unacceptable risk. Risks associated with the land’s future use will continue
                        to be dealt with under the planning and building standards system. Some
                        functions of Part IIA, planning and building standards regimes may, at
                        times, overlap.</para>

                        ‘suitable for use approach’ that requires the current risks to be assessed
                        and remediated as required, for a site’s existing use. The primary
                        regulatory role for this rests with the local authorities. Local authorities
                        and SEPA must establish public registers to record all prescribed regulatory
                        action taken under Part IIA. The register will contain particulars relating
                        to the remediation, as well as notifications of the identification of
                        contaminated land. The registers will expand as new information is
                        identified.</para>

                        ‘contaminated land’ as defined under the Act may still contain harmful or
                        dangerous substances and the following guidance should be useful to the
                        local authority in carrying out its other functions.</para>

                        of being contaminated is a material consideration when local authorities
                        determine planning applications. The key role of the planning system is to
                        ensure that all the ground included within the planning application is
                        suitable for the proposed future use. Conditions may be added to any

                    <para>During a walk-over of the area there may be signs of possible
                        contaminants. The preliminary investigation can assist in the design of the
                        exploratory and detailed ground investigation. A detailed ground
                        investigation may be necessary and should provide sufficient information for
                        the risk assessment and the design and specification of any remedial <link

                        Generic assessment criteria may provide an indication of where further
                        consideration of risk to receptors is required. The selection of assessment
                        criteria should take into account the specific circumstances of the <link
                            linkend="building_site" xreflabel="definedTerm">building site</link> and
                        the receptors that may be exposed. Assessment criteria should be
                        authoritative and scientifically based. Should a risk be indicated then
                        further consideration would be warranted. This may involve collection and
                        assessment of further information. Useful tools for undertaking detailed
                        assessment of risk are available e.g. CONSIM and CLEA. Reference should be

                        be undertaken either in-situ (contaminants are treated in the ground) or
                        ex-situ (contaminated material is excavated and then treated before being
                        returned). The processes convert the contaminant into a neutral form or
                        render it harmless. There are also solidification and stabilisation
                        processes that can ‘fix’ contaminants in the soil so as to reduce the harm,
                        and thermal processes that alter the contaminant by incineration or by
                        volatilisation. The exact process to use will depend on the contaminant

                        fitting. Where the connection is to a public sewer, the Water Authority

                    <para>Differences in plumbing within Europe have led to a variety of systems
                        being developed. These have happened as a result of differences in the type
                        and use of sanitary appliances in Member States. The European Standards
                        describe the 4 main systems in use but it is expected that traditional
                        practices will continue in the various countries. However care will need to
                        be taken if different systems are used to ensure that the entire system
                        operates satisfactorily and that the system designed and installed is
                        compatible with, and suitable for, connection to existing <link

                        consists of 2 main components, a watertight underground tank into which raw
                        sewage is fed and a system designed to discharge the <link
                            linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm">wastewater</link> safely to
                        the environment without pollution. This is normally an infiltration field
                        through which <link linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >wastewater</link> is released to the ground, but when ground conditions
                        are not suitable, a discharge to a watercourse or coastal waters may be
                        permitted. The infiltration field provides secondary treatment and is often
                        critical for protecting the environment from pollution. Not all treatment
                        plants treat to the same standard, for example, biological treatment plants
                        treat the <link linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm"

                            >wastewater</link> thus reducing pollution and permitting a smaller
                        infiltration field. As there are many different types of treatment plants
                        with varying degrees of efficiency, then the type chosen should be selected
                        for the effluent standard required to protect the environment.</para>

                        <para>The intention of this standard is to ensure that non-mains drainage
                        systems are designed and constructed to a standard so that the discharges
                        from them do not contribute to environmental pollution and will achieve
                        statutory environmental standards. Subject to discharge authorisation from
                        SEPA, (see clause 3.8.5) wastewater from treatment systems can either
                        discharge to land via an infiltration system or to watercourses, lochs or
                        coastal waters. The guidance to this standard deals with discharges to land
                        via infiltration systems. The infiltration method will form a critical part
                        of the treatment system and care must be taken in the type, design and
                        location chosen to avoid environmental pollution. The guidance to this
                        standard should be used in conjunction with the guidance to Standard 3.8
                        when designing wastewater treatment systems.</para>

                    <para>The preliminary assessment may indicate that the ground is unsuitable for
                        the installation of an infiltration system, in which case an alternative
                        disposal method should be considered.</para>
          
                        <para>Second, a trial hole should be dug to determine the position of the
                        water table and soil conditions. This trial hole will enable the sub-soil
                        type to be determined. The trial hole should be a minimum of 2m deep, or a
                        minimum of 1.5m below the invert of the proposed distribution pipes. The
                        trial hole should be left covered for a period of 48 hours before measuring
                        any water table level. Subsoils that overlay bedrock allow water to move
                        through the pore spaces between the grains of material of which they are
                        composed. They are the first line of defence against pollution and act as a
                        protecting filtering layer. Where these materials are unsaturated, pollution
                        attenuation processes are often enhanced. Water flows through much of
                        Scotland’s bedrock via fissures. Attenuation of contaminants is limited in
                        these cases. For safe and effective dispersal of the <link
                            linkend="wastewater" xreflabel="definedTerm">wastewater</link>, the
                        groundwater and bedrock should be at least 1m below the bottom of the
                        distribution pipes. It should also be noted that it is the seasonally
                        highest level of the water table that should be determined for the
                        infiltration area.</para>
                  
                        <para>Third, to determine the type of infiltration system and the area of
                        ground required, percolation tests should be carried out. These percolation
                        tests should be carried out using either of the following
                            methods:<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">

                                <para>excavate a minimum of two percolation holes, not less than 5m
                                    apart along the line of and below the proposed invert level of
                                    the effluent distribution pipe. Each hole should be 300mm square
                                    to a depth of 300mm. Where deep drains are necessary, the holes
                                    should conform to this shape at the bottom but may be enlarged
                                    above the 300mm level to facilitate safe excavation. Fill the
                                    300mm square section of the holes to a depth of at least 300mm
                                    with water and allow them to seep away overnight. It is
                                    important to saturate the soil surrounding the test holes to
                                    simulate day to day conditions in an operational drainage field.
                                    Next day, refill the test sections of the percolation holes with
                                    water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time (t) in
                                    seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% to 25% full level.
                                    Divide this time by 150mm. The answer gives the average time in
                                    seconds (Vp) required for the water to drop 1mm. Take care when
                                    making the tests to avoid unusual weather conditions such as
                                    heavy rain, severe frost or drought. To obtain consistent
                                    results carry out the test at least 3 times for each percolation
                                    hole and take the average figure.</para>

                        difficult to pinpoint the exact route the rainwater is taking. For example,
                        a damp patch on a ceiling could be the result of a faulty flashing or
                        damaged felt on a <link linkend="flat_roof" xreflabel="definedTerm">flat

                        that the amount of rainfall has increased across much of Scotland. In
                        addition, the majority of research indicates that this trend may continue as

                        Failure to do so can lead to inadequate internal conditions, e.g.

                    <para>The occurrence of condensation is governed by complex interrelationships

                        materials. Condensation need not always be a problem, for example it
                        regularly occurs on the inner surface of the outer leaf of a cavity wall
                        which receives very much more water from driving rain. However excess
                        condensation can damage the <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> fabric and contents and the

                        lists various issues that should be considered in the design of roofs to

                        be avoided because interstitial condensation is likely and its effect on the
                        structure and insulation can be severe and many instances of failure in such

                        loss than its surroundings. These ‘bridges’ commonly occur around openings

                        junctions and where internal walls penetrate the outer fabric. Thermal

                        allow a heat flow entirely disproportionate to their surface area resulting
                        in excessive heat losses. Condensation may occur on the inner surfaces that

                    <para>The installation of mechanical extract fans is not in itself dangerous but
                        guidance on their use has been included under this standard as their use
                        with <link linkend="open_flued_appliance" xreflabel="definedTerm">open-flued
                            appliances</link> can cause problems. Extract fans lower the pressure in

                        poisoning if they are poorly installed or commissioned, inadequately
                        maintained or incorrectly used. Inadequate ventilation or a lack of the

                        poisoning. Poisonous CO gas is produced when fuel does not burn properly.
                        Incidents of poisoning can also occur through deterioration of the structure
                        of the <link linkend="flue">flue</link> or <link linkend="chimney"

                        produced in high levels from appliances where incomplete combustion of a
                        carbon based fuel occurs. Incomplete combustion could occur in appliance

                    <para>The guidance on oil relates only to its use solely where it serves a

                            <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link>. There
                        is other legislation covering the storage of oils for other purposes.
                        Heating oils comprise Class C2 oil (kerosene) or Class D oil (gas oil) as
                        specified in BS 2869: 2006.</para>
                    <para>It is considered unlikely that a fire will originate from the stored oil.
                        It is the purpose of this guidance therefore, to ensure that a fire that may
                        originate from a <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link>, or other external source, is not transferred to the
                        tank contents, or if a fire does occur, its effects are limited.</para>
                   
                        <para>The acceptance of climate change and the environmental policies put in
                        place to mitigate its impact are pushing the commercial introduction of
                        renewable energy technologies to displace the use of fossil fuels and the
                        related combustion emissions of greenhouse gases. Woody biomass can be used
                        as an alternative to fossil fuels and in some EU countries biomass fuel is
                        the principal source of renewable energy for heating applications. The
                        carbon dioxide emitted when biomass is burnt can be considered to be offset
                        by the carbon dioxide absorbed as trees grow. Whilst this does not
                        compensate for the energy used in processing the wood for fuel, the carbon
                        dioxide emissions are considerably less than those of fossil fuels.</para>
              
                        <para>The use of woody biomass, in the form of wood chips, wood pellets and
                        logs may offer a viable alternative to fossil fuels, particularly in areas
                        not served by the gas grid, although the supply and distribution of chips
                        and pellets is, as yet, still developing with increasingly more suppliers
                        available.</para>

                        igniting. To ensure maximum energy from the fuel, all storage should be
                        designed to be damp free and improve or maintain the moisture content of the
                        fuel at time of delivery. To inhibit the spread of fire to their contents,
                        bulk storage for wood fuels should be located in accordance with the

                    <para>Oil is a common and highly visible form of water pollution. Because of the
                        way it spreads, even a small quantity can cause a lot of harm to the aquatic
                        environment. Oil can pollute rivers, lochs, groundwater and coastal waters
                        killing wildlife and removing vital oxygen from the water.</para>
                    
                        <para>Oil is a ‘List I’ substance within the meaning of the EC Groundwater
                            Directive (80/68/EEC). The UK government is required by this directive
                            to prevent List I substances from entering groundwater and to prevent
                            groundwater pollution by List II substances.</para>
                    <para>The storage of oil is a controlled activity under the Water Environment
                        (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 and will be deemed to be
                        authorised if it complies with The Water Environment (Oil Storage)(Scotland)
                        Regulations 2006. Enforcement is by SEPA.</para>

                        likely to be delivered in bulk. If the storage container is too small, the
                        number of journeys by delivery vehicles will make unnecessary use of diesel
                        fuel. Wood chips tend to be used in large boilers supplying heat to district

                    <title>3.25.0 Introduction</title>
                    <para>Scotland produces large quantities of waste – almost 17 million tonnes in
                        2010. This comes from a range of sources with household waste accounting for
                        2.8 million tonnes. The revised EU Waste Framework Directive establishes the
                        legislative framework for handling of waste in the European Union. The
                        Directive lays down that Member States must have a National Waste Management
                        Plan, or Plans.   </para>
                    <para>In June 2010 the Scottish Government launched its Zero Waste Plan which
                        set out actions to deliver important changes to how Scotland treats and
                        manages waste. The plan includes a 70% recycling rate for household and all
                        other waste streams by 2025. The Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2012 provide
                        statutory measures to support delivery of the zero waste agenda by
                        requiring, amongst other aspects, separate collection and treatment of
                        waste.   </para>
                    <para>The Environmental Protection Act, 1990 gives powers to the waste
                        collection authority to stipulate the type and number of containers to be
                        used. The Act also empowers the waste collection authority to designate a
                        collection point for removal of the waste and this is normally at the
                        curtilage of the <link linkend="dwelling">dwelling</link>. Under the Zero
                        Waste Plan local authorities are required to provide householders with
                        separate collection services for dry recyclables (glass, metals, plastics,
                        paper and card) by the end of 2013 and for food waste by the end of 2015. </para>
                    <para>Currently local authorities meet their obligations in different ways and
                        designers need to be aware of these local initiatives and make suitable
                        provision in their designs.   </para>

                        also accessible to people should be at least 2m high while individual
                        enclosures of wheeled bins only need to be high enough to allow the lid to

                        route along which the container can be transported to the collection point.
                        Over a short distance in an urban area it would be reasonable to use the

                    <para>Silage effluent is the most prevalent cause of point source water
                        pollution from farms in Scotland. A high proportion of serious pollution
                        incidents occur each year through failure to contain or dispose of effluent
                        satisfactorily.</para>
                    <para>Collection, storage and disposal of farm effluent and livestock wastes are
                        all stages when pollution can occur. These materials are generally
                        classified by type of stock and physical form. This may be solid, semi-solid
                        or liquid. Solids are stored in dungsteads that must be properly drained and

                                <para>Scottish Water estimate that the average consumption of
                        wholesome water per person in Scotland is around 150 litres per day.  Water
                        consumption has increased over the last few decades and is projected to
                        continue to rise.    Around 30% of the average household’s heating bills are
                        spent on heating water for sanitary, health or hygiene purposes. Therefore
                        the provision of sanitary appliances and fittings that use water more
                        efficiently can assist in the reduction of associated carbon emissions and
                        the home owner’s energy costs.   </para>

                        associated water fittings and also the volume of water discharged from them.
                        Therefore, controlling the volume of water discharged from <link
                            linkend="sanitary_facility">sanitary facilities</link> and fittings
                        should contribute to reducing the use of water.   </para>

                        degrees of benefits. For certain sanitary facilities reducing the water use
                        will be related to its function. For example a bath is generally filled to a
                        water level that suits the occupant and therefore controlling water flow
                        from taps to that facility would only serve to extend the amount of time
                        taken to fill the bath.   </para>
                    <para>Most WCs produced today are now of the dual flush type which give users
                        the option of a reduced flush, generally for liquid waste or a full flush
                        for solid waste. The flush volume will generally be achieved through the
                        valve mechanism of the WC cistern.    </para>
                    <para>To reduce the water flow rates at taps for wash or hand rinse basins
                        (WHBs) options include the installation of flow restrictors, or aerators.
                        These may be fitted in either the water supply pipes serving the sanitary
                        facilities or incorporated within the tap components. </para>

                        element between 800mm and 1.15m above floor level. A vision panel is not

                    <para>In the interests of safety, protective barriers should be provided where
                        there is a sudden change in level and the possibility of severe injury from
                        a fall.</para>
                    <para>At a change of direction on an access route, a drop of any height can be a
                        hazard, particularly to a wheelchair user or a person with a visual
                        impairment. A protective barrier should be provided both where a significant
                        drop occurs and in locations where a smaller change of level may increase
                        the risk of injury.</para>
                    <para>It is not practical to provide a barrier at every change in level, but a
                        protective barrier for pedestrians should be provided at the edge

                    <para>To ensure this, openings in a protective barrier should prevent the

                        flights and landings and 50 lux elsewhere within circulation areas. Lighting
                        should not present sources of glare and should avoid creation of areas of
                        strong shadow that may cause confusion or miss-step. A means of automatic
                        control should be provided to ensure that lighting is operable during the

                        and the risk of fire. Similarly, use of extension leads can create a trip

                    <para>Whilst police statistics show signs of housebreaking decreasing since
                        1999, people’s perception of their likelihood of falling victim to this type
                        of crime continues to increase. The 2003 Scottish Crime Survey identified
                        that one in ten people consider it ‘very’ or ‘fairly’ likely that their home
                        would be broken into within the next twelve months. This is an increase on
                        the same response in 2000 and is double the proportion of households who
                        were actually victims of housebreaking in preceding years.</para>
                    <para>As almost half of the recorded incidents of housebreaking occur when a
                        property is occupied, it is not surprising that housebreaking is rated
                        amongst the crimes that cause people most concern and worry. However basic
                        measures to improve the physical security of dwellings, including robust
                        specification of doors, windows, glazing and locks, can act deter the

                    <para>‘Secured by Design’ is the established police initiative to design out
                        elements within development that may contribute to housebreaking and other
                        crimes. ‘Secured by Design’ accreditation considers site design and layout
                        as well as physical security measures and offers a more comprehensive
                        solution than those physical provisions set out within this standard. As
                        ‘Secured by Design’ is assessed on a site-specific basis, the police can
                        also offer recommendations on appropriate additional measures in areas where
                        the risk of crimes, such as housebreaking, are considered greater.

                    <para>Noise is unwanted sound. In order to limit the effects of unwanted sound
                        the standards intend to improve the resistance of <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> elements to sound transmission.
                        Research has presented clear evidence that noise can indirectly contribute
                        to a range of health issues such as stress and anxiety.</para>
                    <para>Inadequate sound insulation can impair health by allowing noise from other
                        people to disrupt normal life. A number of people in attached homes complain
                        of neighbour noise. The World Health Organisation has established a
                        relationship between noise exposure and sleep disturbance. However, the
                        short or long-term effects are still not clear. Over the years, several
                        pieces of legislation relating to noise (see clause 5.0.9) have been
                        introduced which provide some degree of control of ‘noisy
                        neighbours’.</para>
                    <para>Noise generated within a dwelling, to some extent, is under the control of
                        the occupants but can still create tension within a family. The provision of
                        sound absorption between rooms should allow people a degree of privacy as
                        they go about their everyday activities.</para>

                    <title>5.0.2 Aims</title>
                    <para>The purpose of the standards in Section 5 is to limit the transmission of
                        sound to a level that will not threaten the health of occupants from sound
                        transmission emanating from attached <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">buildings</link> and a differently occupied part
                        of the same <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >building</link>. They also cover sound from within the same <link
                            linkend="dwelling" xreflabel="definedTerm">dwelling</link> if occupants
                        are in <link linkend="room" xreflabel="definedTerm">rooms</link> where they
                        would expect to have some degree of peace and quiet.</para>
                    <para>It is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee freedom
                        from unwanted sound transmission. The standards aim to limit the effects
                        from sound levels created from normal domestic activities, but not from
                        excessive noise from things such as power tools, audio systems
                        inconsiderately played at high volume or even raised voices. The standards
                        do not address environmental noise through the <link linkend="buildings"
                            xreflabel="definedTerm">building</link> facade from sources such as
                        aircraft, trains, road traffic or industry. Other legislation covers these
                        areas and further information may be obtained from Planning Advice Note PAN

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Home improvements</emphasis> were previously not
                        considered an issue, whereas some can now create a noise nuisance. For
                        example, lifting carpets and replacing them with laminate flooring can have
                        an adverse affect on sound transference in buildings, and particularly on
                        occupants of flats. A leaflet giving further information on home

                                    area. A reduction in sound transmission and increase in sound
                                    insulation are expected with increasing mass, as the heavier the

                                    an increase in sound insulation are expected by the use of
                                    cavities with fewer and less stiff connections, while absorptive
                                    material hung in the wall cavity will absorb mid to high
                                    frequency sound energy. The formation of narrow cavities, such

                        sound on the other side. There is a loss in sound transmission as the

                        a wall or floor for example) increases. This also varies with the direction

                        perceived as a result of direct transmission. Flanking transmission can
                        occur, for instance, when a wall abuts the face of the inner leaf of an
                        external cavity wall, and the walls are insufficiently tied or bonded
                        together, thus allowing the noise to travel along the inner leaf.</para>

                    <title>5.1.0 Introduction</title>
                    <para>Noise nuisance outwith the control of dwelling occupants has increased
                        substantially over the last decade. This is mainly as a result of people’s
                        changing lifestyles, greater numbers and use of sound-producing equipment
                        and household appliances.</para>
                    <para>There has been a dramatic increase in the use of electrical goods,
                        particularly sound producing equipment such as audio and TV. Music can be
                        more bass orientated and played at higher volumes, whilst speakers mounted
                        on walls may improve the quality to the listener, they can create a
                        disturbance to others. The intention is not to prevent all sound from being
                        heard, but to limit noise nuisance by achieving levels of sound insulation
                        that will help to reduce the effects of sound on people in their
                        home.</para>
                    <para>Complaints regarding noisy services do occur. Dealing with the varying
                        levels of sound produced by service equipment, such as lifts, heat pumps or
                        air conditioning units in <link linkend="buildings" xreflabel="definedTerm"
                            >buildings</link> is a complex task. Guidance is given on the care that
                        should be taken at the design stage in the choice of service equipment,
                        installation and location within the building.</para>
                    <para>Designers should be aware that some Local Authorities may also set noise
                        reduction targets. This is usually enforced through environmental health and
                        planning legislation for noise emanating from commercial premises to
                        dwellings, and more information on this is contained in PAN 1/2011.</para>

                    <para>The conversion of a roof space into a habitable area, although very

                    <para>Changing lifestyles has altered the way rooms are used in dwellings.
                        Bedrooms are more often used as areas where people spend time watching
                        television, playing computer games and listening to music. Shouting from
                        room to room, running up and down stairs, using noisy appliances and banging
                        doors, can all be heard throughout a dwelling and can create unwanted noise.
                        At night, any noise made when generally there is little background noise, is
                        often perceived as excessive.</para>
                    <para>Although noise within a dwelling, can be more easily controlled than noise
                        from outwith the dwelling itself, this can still be a nuisance. The increase
                        in noise level from speech and music within dwellings may indirectly lead to
                        anxiety and stress.</para>

                            xreflabel="definedTerm">built</link> off the structural floor. A door
                        located in such a wall provides a path for sound to bypass a wall under
                        test. On-<link linkend="site" xreflabel="definedTerm">site</link> sound
                        testing of internal walls and intermediate floors cannot be relied upon due
                        to excessive flanking sound transmission through doors. For this reason a
                        laboratory test is used. A laboratory test result is termed dB

                        the sound performance level below. An internal wall between an en-suite
                        bathroom and the apartment it serves need not have sound insulation.</para>

                        /> creates a statutory framework for delivery of greenhouse gas emissions
                        reductions in Scotland. The Act sets an interim target of a 42% reduction in
                        emissions (compared to 1990) by 2020, and an 80% reduction target for 2050,

                        systems in a new <link linkend="dwelling">dwelling</link>. The guidance sets
                        an overall level for maximum carbon dioxide emissions in <link

                        achieve compliance with Standard 6.1, it will be necessary to improve upon
                        some or all of these backstop levels or incorporate additional energy

                        is not subject to Standard 6.1. In view of this, measures to limit energy
                        demand and carbon dioxide emissions rely primarily upon the performance of
                        the new <link linkend="buildings">building</link> fabric. </para>
                    <para>As the majority of <link linkend="construct">construction</link> work for
                        an extension will be new, there will seldom be the need to consider <link

                        sometimes the case for <link linkend="convert">conversions</link> and

                    <para>Unlike a new <link linkend="buildings">building</link>, an extension to an

                        improve on the new build backstops identified in clause 6.2.1 to limit

                    <para>It is proposed to form two <link linkend="room">rooms</link> in the roof
                        space of an existing single storey dwelling. The extra floor area created
                        (including opening for stairway) will be 36.4m<superscript>2</superscript>.
                        A plan and section of the proposed layout is shown in the figure below. A
                        key part of the design is to create as much headroom as possible below the
                        new coombe ceilings. The existing rafters are only 150mm deep therefore it
                        is difficult to achieve the recommended elemental <link linkend="u_value"
                            >U-value</link> of 0.18 (see column (b) in the table to clause 6.2.9),
                        without using branders or having an excessive thickness of insulated ceiling
                        lining. The principal compensatory measure will be to highly insulate the
                        attic walls that occur directly below the lowest part of the coombes. The
                        existing gables will be provided with insulated internal wall lining to

                    <para>It is proposed to form a single room, flat-roof extension to the rear of

                        extension is 18.0m<superscript>2</superscript> and it is to be built over
                        existing openings totalling 1.5m<superscript>2</superscript> in area. A plan
                        and section of the proposed layout is shown in the figure below. A key
                        element of the design is provision of significant glazing
                            (5.0m<superscript>2</superscript>) to the end wall of the extension to
                        provide views across the large garden and rooflights
                            (2.0m<superscript>2</superscript>) to maximise light into the existing

                        with Standard 6.2, it is proposed to increase insulation <link

                        Since 2005, progress has been made by strengthening the standards on, for
                        example, energy efficiency and accessibility for all new buildings<emphasis
                            role="italic"> </emphasis>so they are comparable with the best in

                    <para>Whilst the standards within Sections 1 - 6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks
                        deliver a level of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy
                        efficiency, surface water drainage and sound insulation, there is always the
                        possibility of going beyond the minimum standard. Scottish Ministers
                        consider that it is not practicable at this time to require every building
                        to incorporate higher performance standards or further sustainability
                        measures. However developers may wish to gain recognition for building to
                        higher standards. Additionally, organisations such as planning authorities
                        or funding bodies may choose to make constructing to a higher level of
                        sustainability a condition of approval or funding. </para>
                    <para>Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher
                        quality buildings to be created and for such benefits to be formally
                        recognised. The introduction of Section 7 is the next step in encouraging
                        the sustainable design and construction of all new buildings within a
                        broader context of sustainable development. Further reductions in carbon
                        dioxide (CO<subscript>2</subscript>) emissions from new buildings will also assist in meeting
                        targets within the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.  </para>

                    <para>There are areas considered inappropriate for inclusion in the optional

                        related to building design such as material sourcing and embodied energy.
                        However the Sullivan Report ('A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for
                        Scotland'; published by Scottish Ministers in 2007) recommends total-life
                        zero carbon buildings by 2030. This standard can respond in due course to
                        the growing relative importance of embodied energy as the performance of new
                        buildings improves further. At present these areas are outside the scope of

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Level</emphasis> is the term used as a banding,

                    <title>7.1.0 Statement of sustainability (sustainability label)</title>
                    <para>The statement of sustainability (sustainability label, or SL) that
                        includes the level of sustainability achieved must be fixed to the building
                        prior to completion. The sustainability label should be indelibly marked and
                        located in a position that is readily accessible, protected from weather and
                        not easily obscured. A suitable location could be in a internal cupboard
                        containing a utility meter or the owner may choose to display the label in a
                        more prominent location. An example of an approved label with the overall
                        level achieved on the left hand side and the levels achieved in each of the
                        individual aspects of sustainability on the right hand side is given in
                        Annex E. A program to generate such a label that is specific to a building
                        can be accessed here: <link xlink:href="http://www.s7sust.co.uk/"/>. </para>

                    <para>The specified level of sustainability for a dwelling should be selected
                        from the following:</para>
                    <itemizedlist>

                            <para>Bronze or Bronze Active </para>

                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                    <para>The aim is for balance in the setting of upper levels because
                        sustainability is considered in the round rather than focusing on issues of
                        energy or carbon emissions clauses  7.1 — 7.1.1. Reaching upper levels
                        should be a valid target for any new development, regardless of size or
                        location. Generally, levels have been set to avoid individual aspects that
                        could upset applications which might otherwise meet all of the other aspects
                        of sustainability.</para>
                    <para>The first optional upper level ‘Silver’ offers substantial benefits in a
                        range of sustainability aspects which should be achievable by a sector of
                        the mainstream market. The second optional upper level ‘gold’ is a more
                        demanding target, initially aimed at those intent on pursuing best practice. </para>
                    <para>Buildings that exceed a gold sustainability level are also welcomed. A
                        third upper level called 'platinum' has been reserved for further
                        recognition within the building standards system. At present, only the
                        aspect of carbon dioxide emissions has been defined for this level.</para>
                    <para>Buildings that exceed Bronze, Bronze Active, Silver, Silver Active or Gold
                        levels by achieving a higher level criteria in one or more of the aspects
                        are welcome. This additional achievement will be reflected on the
                        sustainability label. However the achievement of the next upper level will
                        only be recognised once all aspects of that particular level have been
                        included. The award of an overall upper level depends upon meeting all
                        aspects, rather than allowing trade-offs to achieve a score, reinforcing the
                        fact that sustainable outcomes rely on holistic integrated design. </para>
                    <para>The specified levels of sustainability in clauses 7.1.2 to 7.1.7, are sets
                        of measures that are transparent to all including verifiers, planners,
                        funding bodies, owners and tenants. To meet this standard, it should not be
                        necessary to secure expert evaluation beyond that already used in the design
                        to demonstrate compliance with the standards in Sections 1 to 6.</para> </sect2>

                        (LZCGT) in respect of meeting Standard 6.1 within Section 6, Energy. This
                        level is primarily to assist local authorities to meet their obligations
                        under Section 72 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 by identifying
                        the use of LZCGT. In this respect, LZCGTs include: wind turbines, water
                        turbines, heat pumps (all varieties), solar thermal panels, photovoltaic
                        panels, combined heat and power units (fired by low emission sources), fuel

                        and, in addition, the dwelling should comply with the Silver level in each

                        information could be repeated for each type, taking care to ensure correct

                        These can be mixed because consistency in style is less important than
                        content. Illustrations do not need to be to scale, but should show
                        relationships and explain things quickly and easily. These guidelines should

                    <para>The Construction Products Regulation (CPR),  in force in the UK on 1 July
                    2013 permits the use of  a wide range of standards and specifications recognised
                    throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) (see Note 1). </para>
                <para>Standards of safety, suitability and fitness measured against factors common
                    throughout Europe are intended to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade. The
                    European Standards body (CEN), see clause 0.8.2 produce harmonised European
                    Standards (EN) to replace the variety of standards used throughout Member States
                    (see Note 2). These ENs have been or will be published in the UK by the British
                    Standards Institution (BSI) as a BS EN. Once a BS EN is published, the old BS
                    will co-exist for a  transitional period (normally 1 year) with the
                    corresponding BS. Until the BS EN comes into force both BS and BS EN may be
                    referenced. At the end of the transitional period the BS is withdrawn and the BS
                    EN must be adopted.</para>
                    <para>The complex processes involved in the production of European Standards can
                        create lengthy development times. European Standards in draft form are
                        termed prEN and are released into the public domain when they are issued for
                        consultation. It has been found necessary, occasionally, to reference prEN
                        in the Technical Handbooks where no other suitable document yet
                        exists.</para>
                    <para>Any reference in the Technical Handbooks to a British Standard (BS),
                    British Standard Code of Practice (CP), European Standard (BS EN or prEN) or
                    International Standard (BS EN ISO) is to a standard published by BSI. Where a
                    revision or a newer standard has since been produced, this newer version may be
                    used as an alternative, unless otherwise stated in the handbooks. Any reference
                    in the handbooks to a particular requirement or recommendation of such a
                    standard should be taken, unless the context otherwise requires, as including
                    reference to any relevant commentary and defined terminology contained in that
                    standard. Attention is also drawn to the status accorded to standards and
                    specifications recognised elsewhere in the EEA which provide an equivalent
                    standard – see the guidance to Regulation 8, Materials, durability and
                    workmanship. Compliance with the standards contained in publications in this
                    category represent compliance with the appropriate standards referred to
                    elsewhere in the handbooks and is acceptable until a relevant harmonised
                    standard is introduced.</para>
