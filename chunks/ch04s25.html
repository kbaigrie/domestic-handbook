                        way it spreads, even a small quantity can cause a lot of harm to the aquatic
                        environment. Oil can pollute rivers, lochs, groundwater and coastal waters
                        killing wildlife and removing vital oxygen from the water.</p><p>Oil is a &#8216;List I&#8217; substance within the meaning of the EC Groundwater
                            Directive (80/68/EEC). The UK government is required by this directive
                            to prevent List I substances from entering groundwater and to prevent
                            groundwater pollution by List II substances.</p><p>The storage of oil is a controlled activity under the Water Environment
                        (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 and will be deemed to be
                        authorised if it complies with The Water Environment (Oil Storage)(Scotland)
                        Regulations 2006. Enforcement is by SEPA.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Explanation of terms</strong></span></p><p>The following terms are included below to provide clarity to their meaning
                        in this Technical Handbook.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Catchpit</strong></span> -  means a pit, without a drain,
                        which is capable of containing 110% of the containers storage capacity with
                        base and walls that are impermeable to water and oil.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Integrally bunded tank</strong></span> - means a tank
                        together with a catchpit manufactured as a self-contained unit.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Woody biomass fuel</strong></span> is unlikely to be
                        locally sourced, except for chopped firewood, and for large installations is
                        likely to be delivered in bulk. If the storage container is too small, the
                        number of journeys by delivery vehicles will make unnecessary use of diesel
                        fuel. Wood chips tend to be used in large boilers supplying heat to district
                        heating systems rather than to individual houses. Information on woody
                        biomass fuel can be found on the BSD website under: &#8216;Storage of woody

                        provision is of a size that will ensure bulk deliveries need not be made at
                        intervals of less that 3 months for bulk storage and 6 months for small

                        chips because pellets can have 3 times the calorific value of dry wood
                        chips. Alternatively, the storage volume can be smaller for the same energy
