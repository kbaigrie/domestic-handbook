            <p>Oil is a common and highly visible form of water pollution. Because of the
                                       way it spreads, even a small quantity can cause a lot of harm to the aquatic
                                       environment. Oil can pollute rivers, lochs, groundwater and coastal waters
                                       killing wildlife and removing vital oxygen from the water.
            </p>
            <p>Oil is a &#8216;List I&#8217; substance within the meaning of the EC Groundwater
                                           Directive (80/68/EEC). The UK government is required by this directive
                                           to prevent List I substances from entering groundwater and to prevent
                                           groundwater pollution by List II substances.
            </p>
            <p>The storage of oil is a controlled activity under the Water Environment
                                       (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 and will be deemed to be
                                       authorised if it complies with The Water Environment (Oil Storage)(Scotland)
                                       Regulations 2006. Enforcement is by SEPA.

            <p>The following terms are included below to provide clarity to their meaning
                                       in this Technical Handbook.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Catchpit</strong></span> -  means a pit, without a drain,
                                       which is capable of containing 110% of the containers storage capacity with
                                       base and walls that are impermeable to water and oil.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Integrally bunded tank</strong></span> - means a tank
                                       together with a catchpit manufactured as a self-contained unit.
            </p>

                                       locally sourced, except for chopped firewood, and for large installations is
                                       likely to be delivered in bulk. If the storage container is too small, the
                                       number of journeys by delivery vehicles will make unnecessary use of diesel
                                       fuel. Wood chips tend to be used in large boilers supplying heat to district
                                       heating systems rather than to individual houses. Information on woody

            <p>Care should be taken to prevent leakage from pipework. Pipework should be
                                       run so as to provide the most direct route possible from the tank to the
                                       burner. Joints should be kept to a minimum and the use of plastic coated
                                       malleable copper pipe is recommended. Pipework should be installed in
                                       accordance with the recommendations in BS 5410: Parts 1: 1997 and Part

            <p>In order to best exploit the advantages achieved through the use of woody
                                       biomass as low carbon technology it is recommended that wood fuel storage
                                       provision is of a size that will ensure bulk deliveries need not be made at
                                       intervals of less that 3 months for bulk storage and 6 months for small
                                       installations.
            </p>
            <p>Deliveries of wood pellets may be less frequent than deliveries of wood
                                       chips because pellets can have 3 times the calorific value of dry wood
                                       chips. Alternatively, the storage volume can be smaller for the same energy
                                       capacity.

                                       types that will permit a large enough volume to be delivered whilst

                                       target, designers and developers may use on-site renewable energy
                                       technologies to supply up to 10% of the annual heating demand, rather than
                                       adopting slightly more demanding insulation standards for walls. A small
                                       woody biomass stove or boiler could provide this level of heating.
