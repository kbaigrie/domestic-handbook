                        carry out their statutory duties as efficiently and safely as possible. Fire
                        and rescue service personnel are trained to enter <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> following the outbreak of fire
                        to assist with any evacuation of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> occupants, effect rescues of any
                        casualties and to fight fires. Fire-fighters operational duties are made on
                        a statutory basis in the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 as amended, which
                        states:</p><p>&#8220;Each relevant authority shall make provision for the purpose of &#8211;</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>extinguishing fires in its area</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>protecting life and property in the event of fires in its
                                    area.&#8221;</p></li></ol></div><p>The extent of fire development will vary with each incident and in any
                        situation, the fire and rescue service will assess the need to evacuate the
                        entire <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                        whilst the fire is brought under control. Sometimes, the fire can develop to
                        such an extent that additional fire-fighting teams may need to be summoned
                        from other fire stations or fire authorities.</p><p>Fire-fighters will normally enter a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> through the main entrance and
                        attempt to attack the fire. This is termed &#8216;offensive fire-fighting&#8217; and is
                        normal practice regardless of whether people are in the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> or not. When
                        conditions within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> become too hazardous for fire-fighters to remain, they
                        will normally retreat a safe distance away from the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and
                        implement &#8216;defensive&#8217; fire-fighting tactics to control the spread of fire.
                        In cases where a large fire develops, numerous fire-fighting teams may be
                        involved using a combination of offensive and defensive tactics until the
                        fire is brought under control and extinguished. Due to the high level of
                        fire separation and containment within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> containing <a class="link" href="apa.html#flat">flats</a> and <a class="link" href="apa.html#maisonette">maisonettes</a>, it would be unusual for
                        there to be a need to evacuate the fire floor or the entire building in the
                        event of a fire. The level of fire separation should be such that, other
                        than in the flat of fire origin, residents are safe to remain within their
                        own flat or maisonette. However, circumstances may arise in which
                        fire-fighters consider it necessary to evacuate residents from a small
                        number of other flats and, on very rare occasions, the entire building. An
                        evacuation alert system should be provided to assist the fire and rescue
                        services in the evacuation of high rise domestic buildings if necessary (see
                        clause 2.14.8).</p><p>Whilst fire-fighters are professionally trained to deal with all types of
                        fire condition, the fire and rescue service facilities within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> are
                        important to reduce fire attack time which in turn, could save lives, limit
                        the fire damage to property and improve fire-fighter safety.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a>, as
                        specified in regulation 4, the building as converted shall meet the
                        requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e6188"></a>2.14.1 Fire and rescue service facilities</h3></div></div></div><p>Fire and rescue service facilities may need to be provided in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> to assist
                        with any evacuation of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> occupants, effect rescues of any casualties and to
                        fight fires. The time taken for fire and rescue service intervention is
                        dependent on a number of variables. The time to contact the emergency
                        services, the location of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> in relation to the fire station
                        and the height of the floor of fire origin above or below the fire and
                        rescue service access level.</p><p>Fires in tall <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> or in <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storeys</a> may present additional
                        risks to fire and rescue service personnel. Fire and smoke can suddenly
                        change direction and intensity due to a number of factors which might induce
                        reverse air flows. For example, the wind direction and velocity (which
                        increases with height) could have a significant impact when fire-fighters
                        open the door to the dwelling of fire origin. Similarly, limited ventilation
                        available in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storey</a> can lead to heat and smoke build up that is
                        released through the opening the fire-fighters are using as an entry
                        point.</p><p>It is important that the facilities to assist the fire and rescue services
                        take account of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design. The Building Disaster Assessment Group carried
                        out extensive research on behalf of the UK Government to assess the
                        interaction between <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design and the operational response of fire and rescue
                        services. The subjects covered by the research included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>physiological performance criteria for fire-fighting</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>fire-fighting in under-ventilated <a class="link" href="apa.html#compartment">compartments</a>, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>fire-fighting media in high-rise <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>The research is available on the UK Government website <a class="link" href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/fire/" target="_top">http://www.communities.gov.uk/fire/</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e6212"></a>2.14.2 Number and type of facilities</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Houses</strong></span> - facilities to assist the fire
                        and rescue service need not be provided in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#house">house</a>. This is because the forward
                        control point will be set up outside the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and the operations will commence
                        from that point.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Flats and maisonettes</strong></span> - the further

                        ground, the greater the risk. Therefore, the number and type of facilities
                        should be provided based on the height of the topmost <a class="link" href="apa.html#storey">storey</a> above the fire and rescue service
                        access level, the depth of any <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storeys</a> below the access level
                        and the distance from any fire mains outlets (see clause 2.14.7).</p><p>Facilities that may be necessary include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>fire-fighting stairs (see clause 2.14.3)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>fire-fighting lifts (see clause 2.14.4)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>fire-fighting lobbies (see clause 2.14.5)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>heat and smoke control e.g. natural or mechanical ventilation

                        should complement fire-fighting and rescue capability. The 7.5m storey
                        height above the ground is historically linked to the height at which fire
                        and rescue service personnel can rescue occupants using the standard 13.5m
                        portable ladder. Whilst this practice is no longer common, for health and
                        safety reasons, fire fighters continue to carry out external rescues as a
                        last resort and <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> design should recognise this.</p><p>The 18m storey height above the ground is also historically linked with
                        the reach capability of fire and rescue service equipment such as wheeled
                        escape ladders (now obsolete). The general intent is that <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> with a
                        storey at a height of more than 18m above the access level, cannot be easily
                        reached by fire and rescue service equipment and personnel. Therefore, at
                        least 1 fire-fighting shaft (fire-fighting stair, fire-fighting lobby, fire
                        mains and in some cases a fire-fighting lift) is provided within the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> to allow
                        equipment and personnel to be deployed as quickly as possible.</p><p>In addition, fire-fighters cannot apply water jets from fire hoses onto
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#external_wall">external
                            walls</a> high above the ground because of the limited reach
                        capability. The guidance throughout this handbook including Standard 2.7,
                        fire spread on <a class="link" href="apa.html#external_wall">external walls</a>, recognises this limitation.</p><p>The fire and rescue service facilities recommended in the table should be
                        applied on every storey however the lowest <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storey</a> sets the level of
                        facilities recommended throughout the <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement storeys</a> only. The depth of the
                        lowest <a class="link" href="apa.html#basement_storey">basement
                            storey</a> is measured from the fire and rescue service access level

                        evacuation alert system should be provided to enable the fire and rescue
                        services to initiate operation of fire alarm sounders within each dwelling
                        on any single floor, multiple floors and the entire building, according to
                        circumstances. </p><p>Control equipment for the system should be prominently sited on the normal
                        fire and rescue service entrance level at a location close to the normal
                        fire and rescue service entrance. </p><p>The control equipment should be housed within a cabinet that is secure
                        against vandalism (e.g. with a steel, hinged access door) that prevents
                        sight of the controls within. The cabinet should be locked top and bottom by
                        means of a lock that is openable only with a key that is carried on fire and
                        rescue service appliances.</p><p>A square or rectangular sign, bearing the words &#8220;Evacuation System: For
                        Fire and Rescue Services Use Only&#8221;, should be fixed to the door of the
                        cabinet. The wording should comprise white Sans Serif text, on a red
                        background, with a lower case letter height of at least 10mm. The sign
                        should incorporate the red flames pictogram specified for fire-fighting
                        equipment in BS 5499-10. The sign should be of metal construction and should
                        be fixed to the door of the cabinet by at least four security screws.</p><p>The control equipment should be simple to operate and should not require
                        use of a password, key switch or keypad. Switches should be provided to
                        enable evacuation of any single floor by use of a single switch. The
                        switches should be located in a vertical column on the control equipment,
                        mirroring the floors of the building, with the switch for the topmost floor
                        at the top of the column, and switches for further floors descending floor
                        by floor, with the switch for the lowest floor at the bottom of the column.
                        Switches should be of the biased toggle type. In large blocks of flats,
                        separate switches, sited horizontally, may be provided to enable evacuation
                        of, for example, one wing of any floor, separately from other areas of that
                        floor. A red LED, associated with each switch, should be used to indicate
                        that operation of sounders has been initiated.</p><p>Two further biased &#8220;push to make&#8221; switches should be provided. One of
                        these should cause the evacuation signal to sound throughout all dwellings
                        in the building. The legend &#8220;Evacuate Whole Building&#8221; should be used to show
                        the function of the switch. The second switch should silence all sounders in
                        the building and should bear the legend &#8220;Silence all Sounders&#8221;.</p><p>Facilities not readily available or visible to the fire and rescue service

                        enable operation of the sounder(s) within any single flat or maisonette,
                        independently of sounders in other dwellings. This is to enable testing of
                        the sounder(s) within each flat during routine maintenance.</p><p>The control equipment should, other than in respect of the functions and
                        indications, conform to the requirements of BS EN 54-2.</p><p>Within each flat, at least one fire alarm sounder, conforming to the
                        requirements of BS EN 3, should be provided. Normally, only one sounder is
                        likely to be necessary, but the sound pressure level of the alarm signal at
                        each open bedroom doorway should be at least 85 dB(A). Sound pressure level
                        within other rooms should be at least 60 dB(A).</p><p>All wiring, including the wiring of power supplies, should comprise cables
                        of enhanced fire resistance, as defined in sub-clause 26.2e) of BS 5839-1:
                        2017. An open or short circuit on the wiring of the sounder(s) in any flat
                        should not disable any sounder in any other flat. </p><p>The system may use radio transmission for communication between the
                        control equipment and the sounders, in which case the system should conform
                        to the recommendations of Clause 27 of BS 5839-1: 2017. Additionally, all
                        batteries used within fire alarm sounders should be capable of operating the
                        sounders correctly for at least five years before warning of impending
                        failure of the battery is given at the control equipment, taking into
                        account annual operation of the sounders for at least 30 minutes on one
                        occasion, plus a further 10 minutes each year.</p><p>Mains power for the system should conform to the recommendations of
                        sub-clauses 25.2 and 25.3 of BS 5839-1: 2017. Standby power supplies should
                        comply with the recommendations of sub-clause 25.4 of BS 5839-1: 2017,
                        except that the capacity of standby batteries should be sufficient to
                        maintain the system in the quiescent mode for at least 72 hours, after which
                        sufficient capacity should remain to operate all fire alarm sounders for at
                        least 30 minutes. A green indicator should be provided to indicate the
                        supply of power to the system (from either the mains supply or the standby
                        batteries). A general fault indicator and audible sounder within the control
                        equipment should be provided to indicate any fault on the system that can be
                        detected by the system. Such faults include power supply failures and faults
                        on sounder circuits.</p><p>The system should be designed, installed, and commissioned in accordance
                        with the recommendations of BS 8629 (in preparation at the time of
                        publication of this draft).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e6510"></a>2.14.9 Storey identification signs and dwelling indicator signs</h3></div></div></div><p>To assist the fire and rescue service to identify each storey in a

                        same height.</p><p>To enable the fire and rescue service to deploy resources with the minimum
                        of delay, all storey identification signs should be supplemented by dwelling
                        indictor signs, which provide information as to the dwellings (flats or
                        maisonettes) located on the storey in question. The wording on each dwelling
