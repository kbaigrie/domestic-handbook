                        to the health and comfort of the occupants. Without ventilation it is
                        possible that carbon dioxide, water vapour, organic impurities, smoking,
                        fumes and gases could reduce the air quality by humidity, dust and odours
                        and also reduce the percentage of oxygen in the air to make the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> less
                        comfortable to <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> or
                        live in.</p><p>So that contaminants do not exceed acceptable levels and thereby endanger
                        the health of the occupants, it is important that <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> are adequately ventilated.
                        Research has shown that occupants of <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> are, for the most part, unaware
                        of the standard of air quality within their homes. The lack of recognition
                        of poor air quality has frequently resulted in occupants not being aware of
                        the need to open ventilators or windows, particularly in bedrooms.</p><p>Well designed natural ventilation has many benefits, not least financial
                        and environmental, although it is also recognised that inside air quality
                        can only be as good as outside air quality and in some cases filtration may
                        be necessary. In other cases mechanical systems or systems that combine
                        natural with mechanical (hybrid) may provide the ventilation solution for
                        the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>.</p><p>Ventilation can also have a significant affect on energy consumption and
                        performance and so thorough assessment of natural, as against mechanical
                        ventilation, should be made, as the decision could significantly affect the
                        energy efficiency of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> (see Section 6, Energy).</p><p>Ventilation should not adversely affect comfort and, where necessary,
                        designers might wish to consider security issues and protection against rain
                        penetration prevalent in naturally ventilated <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> when windows are partially open
                        to provide background ventilation.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Reducing air infiltration</strong></span> - improved

                        natural air changes but can increase the risk of condensation. However leaky
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> are
                        draughty and uncomfortable. Sealing up air leaks improves comfort and saves
                        energy whilst proper ventilation keeps the indoor air pleasant and healthy.
                        If poor attention to detail occurs air leakage can account for a substantial
                        part of the heating costs. Energy savings from <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> &#8216;tighter&#8217; could make significant
                        savings on energy bills. There is a common perception that &#8216;tight&#8217; <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> promotes
                        indoor air pollution. However both &#8216;tight&#8217; and 'leaky' <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> can have
                        air quality problems. Though air leaks can dilute indoor pollutants, there
                        is no control over how much leakage occurs, when it occurs or where it comes
                        from. BRE GBG 67, &#8216;Achieving air tightness: General principles&#8217; provides

                        tumble dryer which uses a considerable amount of energy. Drying of washing
                        internally can generate large quantities of moisture that should be removed
                        before it damages the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a>, as

                        vary, dependent on the design and arrangement of air routes through the
                        ventilator. For the purpose of performance, the recommended areas in the

                        sized by the equivalent area, as determined using BS EN 13141-1:2004. When
                        determining the equivalent area, the whole ventilator installation,
                        including the external grille or canopy, should be considered as a single
