            <p>Ventilation of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> is required to maintain air quality and so contribute
                                       to the health and comfort of the occupants. Without ventilation it is
                                       possible that carbon dioxide, water vapour, organic impurities, smoking,
                                       fumes and gases could reduce the air quality by humidity, dust and odours
                                       and also reduce the percentage of oxygen in the air to make the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> less
                                       comfortable to <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> or
                                       live in.
            </p>
            <p>So that contaminants do not exceed acceptable levels and thereby endanger
                                       the health of the occupants, it is important that dwellings are adequately
                                       ventilated. Research has shown that occupants of dwellings are, for the most
                                       part, unaware of the standard of air quality within their homes. The lack of
                                       recognition of poor air quality has frequently resulted in occupants not
                                       being aware of the need to open ventilators or windows, particularly in
                                       bedrooms.
            </p>
            <p>Well designed natural ventilation has many benefits, not least financial
                                       and environmental, although it is also recognised that inside air quality
                                       can only be as good as outside air quality and in some cases filtration may
                                       be necessary. In other cases mechanical systems or systems that combine
                                       natural with mechanical (hybrid) may provide the ventilation solution for
                                       the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Ventilation can also have a significant affect on energy consumption and
                                       performance and so thorough assessment of natural, as against mechanical
                                       ventilation, should be made, as the decision could significantly affect the
                                       energy efficiency of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> (see Section 6, Energy).
            </p>
            <p>Ventilation should not adversely affect comfort and, where necessary,
                                       designers might wish to consider security issues and protection against rain
                                       penetration prevalent in naturally ventilated <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> when windows are partially open
                                       to provide background ventilation.

                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> are
                                       draughty and uncomfortable. Sealing up air leaks improves comfort and saves
                                       energy whilst proper ventilation keeps the indoor air pleasant and healthy.
                                       If poor attention to detail occurs air leakage can account for a substantial
                                       part of the heating costs. Energy savings from <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> &#8216;tighter&#8217; could make significant
                                       savings on energy bills. There is a common perception that &#8216;tight&#8217; <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">construction</a> promotes
                                       indoor air pollution. However both &#8216;tight&#8217; and 'leaky' <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> can have
                                       air quality problems. Though air leaks can dilute indoor pollutants, there
                                       is no control over how much leakage occurs, when it occurs or where it comes
                                       from. BRE GBG 67, &#8216;Achieving air tightness: General principles&#8217; provides

                                       internally can generate large quantities of moisture that should be removed

            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is present in the external air
                                       we breathe at concentration levels of around 400 parts per million and is
                                       not harmful to health at low concentration levels. However, as people
                                       release CO<sub>2</sub> into the air when they exhale, increased
                                       levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in occupied buildings can occur. This
                                       is generally accepted as being a reasonable indication that ventilation
                                       action is necessary.

                                       By improving <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> techniques it is possible to reduce this infiltrating

                                       ventilation provision. By <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> with techniques designed to reduce air leakage there
                                       will need to be a reciprocal increase in the designed ventilation provision
                                       to make up for the lower levels of infiltrating air.

            <p>Recommendations for trickle ventilation in the table below are made on the

                                       will be achieved as a matter of course in modern dwellings. However where
                                       the designer intends to use low fabric infiltration air rates of less than

                                       shown may not suffice to maintain air quality and therefore an alternative

                                       can create unacceptable heat build-up. Efficient ventilation therefore is
                                       very important to ensure a comfortable environment. A <a class="link" href="apa.html#conservatory">conservatory</a>

                                       this is the minimum recommended area, a greater area can provide more
                                       comfortable conditions particularly in sunny weather. Notwithstanding the

                                       best placed to minimise the effects of heat build-up and reduce

                                              ventilator</a>, sometimes called 'background ventilation', is a small
                                       ventilation opening, normally provided with a controllable shutter. Although
                                       routinely provided in the head of a window frame this is often not the best
                                       location as the free movement of air can be restricted, for example by
                                       curtains or blinds. They should be provided in naturally ventilated areas to
                                       allow fine control of air movement. The location of trickle ventilators
                                       should be carefully considered so that they are capable of providing the
                                       intended ventilation, taking into account factors such as the size and shape
                                       of the room and availability of external walls. A <a class="link" href="apa.html#permanent_ventilator">permanent

                                       recognised that the air flow performance through trickle ventilators can
                                       vary, dependent on the design and arrangement of air routes through the
                                       ventilator. For the purpose of performance, the recommended areas in the
                                       table to clause 3.14.3 should be achieved by the use of ventilators that are
                                       sized by the equivalent area, as determined using BS EN 13141-1:2004. When
                                       determining the equivalent area, the whole ventilator installation,
                                       including the external grille or canopy, should be considered as a single
                                       unit.

                                       to clause 3.14.3, to compensate for the reduced air flow caused by friction.
                                       This may over-provide ventilation in some cases but can be regulated by the
                                       fine control.
