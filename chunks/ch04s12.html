            <p>Guidance on design of <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> recommends that the size of individual <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">rooms</a> should be dictated
                                       by the way a <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> should
                                       function and the activities that are to be accommodated rather than by
                                       arbitrary rule of thumb areas. This design philosophy was included in a
                                       report by Sir Parker Morris in the 1960s and is still relevant today.

            <p>Extending standards to address &#8216;liveability&#8217; and the needs of occupants
                                       supports the Scottish Government&#8217;s aim of promoting a more inclusive built
                                       environment and will better address the changing needs of occupants over
                                       time. This approach to the design of <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> ensures that Scotland's <a class="link" href="apa.html#house">housing</a> stock can respond
                                       to the needs of our population, now and in the future.
            </p>
            <p>The provision, on one level, of an enhanced <a class="link" href="apa.html#apartment">apartment</a>, and <a class="link" href="apa.html#kitchen">kitchen</a> under this standard, together
                                       with accessible <a class="link" href="apa.html#sanitary_accommodation">sanitary accommodation</a> (Standard 3.12)
                                       and improvement to circulation spaces (Standard 4.2) will assist in creating
                                       more sustainable homes.
            </p>
            <p>The guidance in this standard and Standard 3.12, together with the
                                       guidance in Section 4, Safety relating to accessibility, has been based
                                       around, and developed from, issues that are included in &#8216;Housing for Varying
                                       Needs&#8217; and the Lifetime Homes concept developed by the Joseph Rowntree
                                       Foundation.

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Drying of washing</strong></span> - from 1963 to 1986 the
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>
                                       regulations included a requirement for the provision of drying facilities.
                                       This was removed in response to increased ownership of specialised
                                       appliances and the vandalism of common drying areas in blocks of flats. The
                                       re-introduction of space to allow washing to be dried other than by a tumble
                                       drier is intended to encourage the use of more sustainable methods and
                                       thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

                                       storage. Such initiatives may affect storage provision in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>.
