                        includes the level of sustainability achieved must be fixed to the building
                        prior to completion. The sustainability label should be indelibly marked and
                        located in a position that is readily accessible, protected from weather and
                        not easily obscured. A suitable location could be in a internal cupboard
                        containing a utility meter or the owner may choose to display the label in a
                        more prominent location. An example of an approved label with the overall
                        level achieved on the left hand side and the levels achieved in each of the
                        individual aspects of sustainability on the right hand side is given in
                        Annex E. A program to generate such a label that is specific to a building
                        can be accessed here: <a class="link" href="http://www.s7sust.co.uk/" target="_top">http://www.s7sust.co.uk/</a>. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e18625"></a>7.1.1 Levels of sustainability</h3></div></div></div><p>The specified level of sustainability for a dwelling should be selected
                        from the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Bronze or Bronze Active </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Silver or Silver Active</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Gold</p></li></ul></div><p>The aim is for balance in the setting of upper levels because
                        sustainability is considered in the round rather than focusing on issues of
                        energy or carbon emissions clauses  7.1 &#8212; 7.1.1. Reaching upper levels
                        should be a valid target for any new development, regardless of size or
                        location. Generally, levels have been set to avoid individual aspects that
                        could upset applications which might otherwise meet all of the other aspects
                        of sustainability.</p><p>The first optional upper level &#8216;Silver&#8217; offers substantial benefits in a
                        range of sustainability aspects which should be achievable by a sector of
                        the mainstream market. The second optional upper level &#8216;gold&#8217; is a more
                        demanding target, initially aimed at those intent on pursuing best practice. </p><p>Buildings that exceed a gold sustainability level are also welcomed. A
                        third upper level called 'platinum' has been reserved for further
                        recognition within the building standards system. At present, only the
                        aspect of carbon dioxide emissions has been defined for this level.</p><p>Buildings that exceed Bronze, Bronze Active, Silver, Silver Active or Gold
                        levels by achieving a higher level criteria in one or more of the aspects
                        are welcome. This additional achievement will be reflected on the
                        sustainability label. However the achievement of the next upper level will
                        only be recognised once all aspects of that particular level have been
                        included. The award of an overall upper level depends upon meeting all
                        aspects, rather than allowing trade-offs to achieve a score, reinforcing the
                        fact that sustainable outcomes rely on holistic integrated design. </p><p>The specified levels of sustainability in clauses 7.1.2 to 7.1.7, are sets
                        of measures that are transparent to all including verifiers, planners,
                        funding bodies, owners and tenants. To meet this standard, it should not be
                        necessary to secure expert evaluation beyond that already used in the design
                        to demonstrate compliance with the standards in Sections 1 to 6.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e18640"></a>7.1.2 Bronze level</h3></div></div></div><p>This is the baseline level for sustainability achieved where the dwelling

                        level is primarily to assist local authorities to meet their obligations
                        under Section 72 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 by identifying
                        the use of LZCGT. In this respect, LZCGTs include: wind turbines, water
