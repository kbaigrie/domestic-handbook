            <p>The statement of sustainability (sustainability label, or SL) that
                                       includes the level of sustainability achieved must be fixed to the building
                                       prior to completion. The sustainability label should be indelibly marked and
                                       located in a position that is readily accessible, protected from weather and
                                       not easily obscured. A suitable location could be in a internal cupboard
                                       containing a utility meter or the owner may choose to display the label in a
                                       more prominent location. An example of an approved label with the overall
                                       level achieved on the left hand side and the levels achieved in each of the
                                       individual aspects of sustainability on the right hand side is given in
                                       Annex E. A program to generate such a label that is specific to a building

            <p>The specified level of sustainability for a dwelling should be selected
                                       from the following:
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Bronze or Bronze Active </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Silver or Silver Active</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Gold</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The aim is for balance in the setting of upper levels because
                                       sustainability is considered in the round rather than focusing on issues of
                                       energy or carbon emissions clauses  7.1 &#8212; 7.1.1. Reaching upper levels
                                       should be a valid target for any new development, regardless of size or
                                       location. Generally, levels have been set to avoid individual aspects that
                                       could upset applications which might otherwise meet all of the other aspects
                                       of sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>The first optional upper level &#8216;Silver&#8217; offers substantial benefits in a
                                       range of sustainability aspects which should be achievable by a sector of
                                       the mainstream market. The second optional upper level &#8216;gold&#8217; is a more
                                       demanding target, initially aimed at those intent on pursuing best practice. 
            </p>
            <p>Buildings that exceed a gold sustainability level are also welcomed. A
                                       third upper level called 'platinum' has been reserved for further
                                       recognition within the building standards system. At present, only the
                                       aspect of carbon dioxide emissions has been defined for this level.
            </p>
            <p>Buildings that exceed Bronze, Bronze Active, Silver, Silver Active or Gold
                                       levels by achieving a higher level criteria in one or more of the aspects
                                       are welcome. This additional achievement will be reflected on the
                                       sustainability label. However the achievement of the next upper level will
                                       only be recognised once all aspects of that particular level have been
                                       included. The award of an overall upper level depends upon meeting all
                                       aspects, rather than allowing trade-offs to achieve a score, reinforcing the
                                       fact that sustainable outcomes rely on holistic integrated design. 
            </p>
            <p>The specified levels of sustainability in clauses 7.1.2 to 7.1.7, are sets
                                       of measures that are transparent to all including verifiers, planners,
                                       funding bodies, owners and tenants. To meet this standard, it should not be
                                       necessary to secure expert evaluation beyond that already used in the design
                                       to demonstrate compliance with the standards in Sections 1 to 6.

            <p>In any dwelling, the home office space can occupy a room by itself even if
                                       this room is too small to be an apartment. In this case, this small room
                                       should be ventilated as if it were an apartment.
            </p>
            <p>In any dwelling, the home office space can occupy a part of the enhanced
                                       apartment but the desk space and its activity space should be additional to
                                       the defined spaces and access of the enhanced apartment, as described in
                                       guidance in Section 3. 
            </p>
            <p>In any dwelling the home office space can be in a room that includes the
                                       kitchen but the desk space and or its activity space should not interfere
                                       with kitchen worktops, appliances or manoeuvring spaces. 
            </p>
            <p>To allow some more flexibility in smaller dwellings (those of not more
                                       than 2 apartments) the home office space can be in any apartment. But in
                                       this case, the desk space and its activity space should not overlap with the
                                       minimum furniture provision or associated activity spaces. 
            </p>
            <p>The height of the home office should be not less than 1.8m over the
                                       activity space and 1.5m over the desk space. For dwellings over 150m<sup>2</sup> floor
                                       area, two home office spaces should be provided.
