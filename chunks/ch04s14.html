            <p>Heating in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is necessary to provide suitable conditions in which to
                                       live. Heating, ventilation and thermal insulation should be considered as
                                       part of a total design that takes into account all heat gains and losses.
                                       Failure to do so can lead to inadequate internal conditions, e.g.
                                       condensation and mould and the inefficient use of energy due to
                                       overheating.
            </p>
            <p>Whole <a class="link" href="apa.html#house">house</a> &#8216;central
                                       heating&#8217; is now almost universal, particularly in new <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> and is
                                       regarded as almost essential in combating problems such as condensation and
                                       mould growth.
            </p>
            <p>Normal activities within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> add both heat and water vapour
                                       to the air. If the heating maintains comfort levels in the whole at all
                                       times, condensation problems will be minimised, but costs will be high. A
                                       reasonable compromise needs to be given to heating and ventilation to reduce
                                       the possibility of such problems and guidance is provided for both these
                                       issues in this sub-section. Section 6, Energy, provides guidance on the
                                       third issue, thermal insulation.

                                       significant affect on the demand for heat. The performance of a heating
                                       system will also have a major affect on energy efficiency. Section 6, Energy
                                       provides guidance on these issues.

                                       will normally be tailored to personal comfort taking cost into
                                       consideration. However in addition to comfort, the heating should reflect
                                       the combined effects of occupancy pattern, ventilation provision, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> mass and
                                       insulation to reduce the possibility of producing excess condensation that

            <p>Alternative heating systems may involve a holistic design approach to the
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> and can
                                       include the use of natural sources of available energy such as the sun, wind
                                       and the geothermal capacity of the earth. Passive design, such as use of the
                                       orientation of <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> for solar gain and of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> mass to store heat with
                                       controlled heat release may only need minor supplementation from a lower
                                       output fixed heating system. Active heating systems, such as heat pumps that
                                       extract heat from ground, air, water or geo-thermal sources, can limit
                                       emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce the use of fossil fuels.
                                       Complementary systems can also be used, to heat water using solar energy or
                                       generate electricity using solar or wind power.
            </p>
            <p>Where there are elderly or infirm occupants in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> the capability of the heating
                                       system to maintain an <a class="link" href="apa.html#apartment">apartment</a> at a temperature higher than
                                           21<sup>0</sup>C is a sensible precaution. Since it is
                                       not possible to determine the occupants at design stage the heating system
                                       should be designed with the capability of being easily upgraded at a later
                                       date.
            </p>
            <p>If an existing heating system is to be upgraded to provide higher
                                       temperatures the boiler size may not need to be replaced, provided it was
                                       correctly sized originally. The upgrading may necessitate the replacement of
                                       some pipes and radiator in one or two <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">rooms</a> and accessibility will need to be
                                       considered. Such modification could result in a small increase in the
                                       recovery time of the hot water supply for bathing and washing.
