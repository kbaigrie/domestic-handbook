                            buildings</a> should be designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> in such a way that the risk
                        of fire is reduced and, if a fire does occur, there are measures in place to
                        restrict the growth of fire and smoke to enable the occupants to escape
                        safely and fire-fighters to deal with fire safely and effectively.</p><p>There are almost 5000 reported fires  in <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> (e.g. <a class="link" href="apa.html#house">houses</a>, <a class="link" href="apa.html#flat">flats</a> and <a class="link" href="apa.html#maisonette">maisonettes</a>) every year in Scotland.
                        Fires can have a devastating effect on the lives of people and results in
                        around 40 deaths and 900 injuries each year. The most common cause of
                        accidental fires in <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> involved cooking appliances (62%), electrical supply
                        or electrical lighting (14%), combustibles ignited due to being too close to
                        candles or other heat source (9%), the remaining 15% is accounted for by the
                        careless disposal of cigarettes and matches and other domestic appliances.
                        Evidence also shows that the consumption of alcohol and/or smoking are
                        contributory factors which increases the risk of an accidental fire
                        occurring. Occupants who are alone at the time of the fire and are in the
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> of fire origin,
                        are more likely to suffer injury (e.g. burns and smoke inhalation) or even
                        death in some cases.</p><p>It is impossible to eliminate the risks from fire altogether and the
                        prevention of deliberate or accidental fires caused by the actions of
                        occupants within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> are outside the scope of building standards. For advice
                        on best practice relating to fire safety in the home, visit the Scottish
                        Fire and Rescue Service website <a class="link" href="http://www.firescotland.gov.uk/" target="_top">http://www.firescotland.gov.uk/</a> or contact the community
                        fire safety team at your local fire station. Although beyond the scope of
                        this guidance, the adoption of good fire safety practices should be
                        encouraged to reduce the risk of fire occurring in the first place. Fire
                        prevention will not only save lives but will protect property and reduce
                        environmental pollution.</p><p>The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together
                        to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements, materials, components
                        or other parts of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> identified in the guidance should follow the
                        appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance.
                        However where an element, material, component, or other part of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is covered
                        by more than one standard, the more demanding guidance should be followed in
                        most cases.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3074"></a>2.0.2 Aims</h3></div></div></div><p>The purpose of the guidance in Section 2 is to achieve the following

                        occupants. Occupants in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">dwellings</a> do not normally perceive themselves to be at risk from
                        fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can spread. The risk
                        to occupants is greater if they are asleep during the outbreak of fire as
                        they are likely to be roused more slowly. Occupants should be warned as soon
                        as possible following the outbreak of fire and the guidance to Standard 2.11
                        provides recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems
                        in <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic

                        the fire and rescue service. For facilities to assist the fire and rescue

                            standards</strong></span> - the guidance contained within this Technical
                        Handbook indicates one or sometimes more than one means of complying with
                        the mandatory building standards 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it
                        is envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing
                        that compliance with the building standards has been achieved. </p><p>However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the
                        guidance it cannot cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or
                        new methods of construction. In such cases the designer or engineer will be
                        required to show, by alternative means, that compliance with the building
                        standards will be achieved in the completed building. For example, where the
                        elements of structure are engineered timber (including cross laminated
                        timber), the structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and
                        fully developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on
                        intervention from the fire and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible
                        elements of structure may require to be provided to protect the structure
                        against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. Where
                        encapsulation (i.e. both physically and in terms of the period of fire
                        resistance duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible
                        material against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire, the
                        structural fire engineer should consider the additional contribution of the
                        exposed combustible material to the fire load density including an
                        assessment of the structural stability of the building due to both potential
                        delamination and failure of the fixings at elevated temperatures.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Fire safety engineering</strong></span> - it is
                        reasonable to demonstrate compliance with the functional standards by
                        alternative means and in such cases, the fire engineer, the building
                        standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early
                        in the design process.</p><p>Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a
                        satisfactory level of fire safety in some large and complex <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> or where
                        innovative or new methods of construction are used. In such cases a holistic
                        approach is desirable from first principles rather than following, in part
                        or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical Handbooks. In such cases
                        the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be
                        consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.</p><p>For many projects it is likely that designers will follow the guidance in
                        the Technical Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be
                        necessary. In its simplest form the QDR team may define the acceptance
                        criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.</p><p>However, it is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged
                        relatively late in the design process to resolve fire safety issues raised
                        during the verification or, in extreme cases, the construction process. This
                        is unhelpful as fire engineers are often commissioned to resolve specific
                        issues where the design does not follow the guidance rather than assessing
                        the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise against
                        unrealistic worse case scenarios of a &#8220;code compliant&#8221; design to justify
                        deviations. This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that
                        the safety goals are well defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of
                        safety. The objective of a comparative study should be to demonstrate that
                        the building design, as a whole, presents no greater risk to the occupants
                        than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the Technical
                        Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of
                        Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks would
                        not merit such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there
                        may be instances where small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a
                        &#8220;whole building&#8221; fire engineered design and inevitably involves a degree of
                        negotiation without the need for detailed analysis.</p><p>Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the
                        appointment of a fire engineer. Reference could be made to &#8216;A simplified
                        approach to alternative fire safety strategies&#8217; Scottish Government (2010),
                        which provides additional advice.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Existing buildings</strong></span> - it may be
                        appropriate to vary the guidance contained in this Handbook when assessing

                        listed in terms of their architectural or historic interest. In such cases,
                        it would be appropriate to take into account a range of fire safety
                        features, some of which are dealt with in this Handbook and some of which
                        are not addressed in any detail. For more detailed information, guidance is

                        complex and many require extensive use of engineering judgement. The
                        following documents are cited to ensure that the guidance given encompasses
                        best practice worldwide:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety engineering

                        fire engineering approach have sufficient technical training, knowledge and
                        experience to understand fully the risks involved.</p><p>The objectives of any fire safety strategy should be established first
                            and designers and verifiers should be aware of the importance of the
                            design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an
                            assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure that the
                            fire safety objectives have been met.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Responsible person</strong></span> - it is important that
                        owners/responsible person understand that the fire safety measures installed
                        in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> need
                        to be maintained and tested over the life time of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> so that they
                        will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the
                        fire engineering strategy are capable of being maintained and deployed over
                        the lifetime of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary
                        due to changes to the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> layout, the original strategy may need to be
                        re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised.
                        For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety
                        risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as
                        amended.</p><p>Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations
                        and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety
                        for a specific <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>, structure or installation. In this regard the fire
                        safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore
                        fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard,
                        assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety
                        strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The &#8216;tools&#8217;
                        that support fire engineering can include calculation methods which are used
                        to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions are
                        maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust fan in
                        a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the smoke
                        layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a stand-by
                        fan.</p><p>It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field
                        and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving
                        problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified
                        above aim to provide a structured framework for assessing the interaction
                        between, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>,
                        people and fire, and to facilitate innovation in design without compromising
                        safety. They provide information on how to undertake a detailed analysis of
                        specific aspects of fire safety engineering in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>.</p><p>In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering
                        approach to fire safety which can be applied to new or existing <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> to show
                        that the functional standards have been met.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety

                        physical standards for the premises. The Inspectorate consults with the fire

                        requirement to comply with the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and associated
                        legislation e.g. any premises in which a &#8220;care home service&#8221; is provided
                        will always fall within the scope of the legislation. Some, but not all,
                        premises in which a &#8220;housing support service&#8221; is provided may also be
                        required to comply e.g. where a House in Multiple Occupation licence is
                        required, etc. It is important that a proportionate approach is taken to
                        ensure the fire safety of the occupants in the event of an outbreak of fire
                        and as such, the dutyholder should take account of the level of dependency
                        of the residents when carrying out a fire risk assessment. Additional fire
                        safety measures including automatic fire suppression may be required in
                        those premises where highly vulnerable occupants cannot self-evacuate the
                        building, for example, where the occupant is bed-ridden or has limited
                        mental capacity and may not respond to the fire alarm.</p><p>Where care services are to be provided in a domestic setting to which the
                        Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 does not apply, the safety of the occupants in the
                        event of an outbreak of fire must still be considered. Any fire safety risk
                        assessment should take account of the level of dependency of the residents.
                        For example, it may be appropriate to consider fire safety equipment such as
                        portable fire suppression and automatic cut-off devices for cookers
                        depending on the risk identified.</p><p>The Specialised Housing guide provides guidance for many domestic premises
                        where the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 does not apply. In those cases it is
                        recommended that a fire safety risk assessment (of both the building and the
                        person) is the best way to protect residents from the risk of fire.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e3379"></a>2.0.9 Annexes</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Annex 2.A - Resistance to fire</strong></span></p><p>Resistance to fire is expressed in terms of fire resistance duration and
