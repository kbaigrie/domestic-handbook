               <p>Life safety is the paramount objective of fire safety. <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">Domestic
                                                 buildings</a> should be designed and <a class="link" href="apa.html#construct">constructed</a> in such a way that the risk
                                          of fire is reduced and, if a fire does occur, there are measures in place to
                                          restrict the growth of fire and smoke to enable the occupants to escape
                                          safely and fire-fighters to deal with fire safely and effectively.
               </p>
               <p>There are more than 7000 reported fires in <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> (e.g. <a class="link" href="apa.html#house">houses</a>, <a class="link" href="apa.html#flat">flats</a> and <a class="link" href="apa.html#maisonette">maisonettes</a>) every year in Scotland.
                                          Fires can have a devastating effect on the lives of people and results in
                                          around 60 deaths and 1700 injuries each year. The most common cause of
                                          accidental fires in <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> is the careless disposal of cigarettes and matches in
                                          more than 40% of cases. Accidents involving cooking accounts for more than
                                          20% followed by electrical, space heaters and candles at around 5%.
                                          Statistics also show that the consumption of alcohol is a contributory
                                          factor which increases the risk of an accidental fire occurring. Occupants
                                          who are alone at the time of the fire and are in the <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> of fire origin, are more likely to
                                          suffer injury (e.g. burns and smoke inhalation) or even death in some
                                          cases.
               </p>
               <p>It is impossible to eliminate the risks from fire altogether and the
                                          prevention of deliberate or accidental fires caused by the actions of
                                          occupants within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> are outside the scope of building standards. For advice
                                          on best practice relating to fire safety in the home, visit the Scottish
                                          Government website <a class="link" href="http://www.dontgivefireahome.co.uk/fire_safety/CCC_FirstPage.jsp" target="_top">http://www.dontgivefireahome.co.uk/fire_safety/CCC_FirstPage.jsp</a> or contact the community fire safety officer at the local fire and rescue
                                          services.
               </p>
               <p>Although beyond the scope of this guidance, the adoption of good fire
                                          safety practices should be encouraged to reduce the risk of fire occurring
                                          in the first place. Fire prevention will not only save lives but will
                                          protect property and reduce environmental pollution.
               </p>
               <p>The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together
                                          to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> elements, materials, components
                                          or other parts of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> identified in the guidance should follow the
                                          appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance.
                                          However where a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> element, material,
                                          component, or other part of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is covered by more than one
                                          standard, the more demanding guidance should be followed.

                                          fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can spread. The risk

                                          they are likely to be roused more slowly. Occupants should be warned as soon

                                          the height of the topmost storey for fire and rescue service facilities, the
                                          height should be measured from the fire and rescue service access level and

               </p>
               <p>The objectives of any fire safety strategy should be established first
                                              and designers and verifiers should be aware of the importance of the
                                              design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an
                                              assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure that the
                                              fire safety objectives have been met.
               </p>
               <p><span class="bold"><strong>Responsible person</strong></span> - it is important that
                                          owners/responsible person understand that the fire safety measures installed
                                          in a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> need
                                          to be maintained and tested over the life time of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> so that they
                                          will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the
                                          fire engineering strategy are capable of being maintained and deployed over
                                          the lifetime of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary
                                          due to changes to the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> layout, the original strategy may need to be
                                          re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised.
                                          For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety
                                          risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as
                                          amended.
               </p>
               <p>Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations
                                          and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety
                                          for a specific <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>, structure or installation. In this regard the fire
                                          safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore
                                          fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard,
                                          assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety
                                          strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The &#8216;tools&#8217;
                                          that support fire engineering can include calculation methods which are used
                                          to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions are
                                          maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust fan in
                                          a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the smoke
                                          layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a stand-by
                                          fan.
               </p>
               <p>It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field
                                          and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving
                                          problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified
                                          above aim to provide a structured framework for assessing the interaction
                                          between, <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>,
                                          people and fire, and to facilitate innovation in design without compromising
                                          safety. They provide information on how to undertake a detailed analysis of
                                          specific aspects of fire safety engineering in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>.
               </p>
               <p>In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering
                                          approach to fire safety which can be applied to new or existing <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> to show
                                          that the functional standards have been met.

                                          analysis should be undertaken. Instead, it is the responsibility of the fire
                                          engineer to plan the analysis for the particular project, based on the

                                          the risk and spread of fire, means of escape, fire-fighting equipment, fire
                                          detection and warning, instruction and training. Other measures are
                                          prescribed by regulation. The fire safety risk assessment should be kept
                                          under continuous review.
