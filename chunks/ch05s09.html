                        themselves to inclusion in other standards although glass and <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> do figure
                        prominently.</p><p>Collision or entrapment accidents result in a significant numbers of
                        deaths and injuries to people in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> every year. The majority of
                        these accidents occur during normal use and involve <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> features
                        such as doors, windows and areas of fixed glazing, with the risk of injury
                        increased where vulnerable glass is involved. Collisions with <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> are very common
                        as it can, if transparent, be difficult to see and may create confusing
                        lighting effects, presenting particular difficulties for a person with a
                        visual or cognitive impairment.</p><p>Falls still result in deaths and serious injury to people while cleaning
                        windows. Whether windows are cleaned professionally or by the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> owner,
                        provision should be made to permit <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> to be cleaned safely.</p><p>Natural ventilation in dwellings is provided by openable windows or
                        rooflights. People may encounter difficulty and a hazard may arise in
                        operating controls which are poorly sited. Similarly, location of electrical
                        sockets, switches and other controls can, if not considered carefully,
                        affect safe and convenient use.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a>, as

                        access can be a hazard. Any element of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> capable of projecting into a
                        circulation route or space should be positioned, secured or guarded so that
                        it does not present a risk to <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> users.</p><p>The simple way to avoid risk is to ensure that obstructions do not
                        encroach into such spaces. However where a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> element does project into a
                        circulation route or space, and any part of the obstruction is less than
                        2.0m above the ground, guarding should be provided to both highlight the
                        hazard and prevent collision with the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> element.</p><p>Guarding should be provided to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>any moveable projection, such as a door leaf or window frame,

                                    the ground, or the projection of which increases with height by
                                    more than 100mm, or</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>any accessible area where headroom reduces to less than 2.0m,
                                    such as beneath a stair flight.</p></li></ul></div><p>Guarding should comprise of a continuous horizontal rail, at a height of
                        between 900mm and 1.1m above ground level and a solid element, such as kerb
                        upstand or rail, positioned approximately 100mm above ground level, to
                        assist in detection by a visually impaired person using a cane.</p><p>There should be visual contrast between guarding rails and surrounding
                        surfaces. Consideration should be given to positioning of guarding to direct
                        a person away from the hazard, further reducing the risk of a
                        collision.</p><p>Additional guarding may be needed to prevent collision with, or entrapment
                        by, a powered door leaf (see clause 4.1.8).</p><p>Within a dwelling, guarding is not needed. A door swing may open into a
                        circulation space provided no obstructions occur within the unobstructed
                        area on a stair landing (see clause 4.3.6), on a ramp landing or that would
                        prevent future installation of a stair lift (see clause 4.2.8).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e14283"></a>4.8.2 Collision with glazing</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">Glazing</a> in certain

                        at low level in screens, walls and partitions or in areas surrounding doors,

                        can be difficult to identify and may be a particular hazard to a person with
                        a visual impairment. Glazing in a building, positioned where accidental
                        collision may be likely, should be made apparent by some form of
                        manifestation (marking). Differences in the design of manifestation used can
                        also assist in identifying the position of doors within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazed</a> screen.</p><p>Manifestation should be of a size and form that is immediately obvious. It
                        should, as far as is <a class="link" href="apa.html#reasonably_practicable">reasonably practicable</a>, contrast visually
                        with backgrounds viewed through the <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> by a person approaching from
                        either side. Forms might include broken or solid lines, patterns or logos
                        and may be a continuous element or at appropriate horizontal intervals.
                        Manifestation should be present within 2 height ranges, between 850mm and
                        1.0m, and between 1.4m and 1.6m above floor level. It should be permanent,
                        e.g. screen printed or opaque etching or a durable applied material which is
                        not easily removed.</p><p>In addition, any unframed <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazed</a> door which operates on a pivot action should have any
                        exposed vertical edge highlighted to contrast visually with surroundings, to
                        assist in identifying the door edge when opening or in an open position.
                        This is particularly important on powered doors.</p><p>Manifestation or highlighting of door edges need only be provided within
                        dwellings where glazing installations are unusual. Familiar elements such as
                        patio doors should not usually attract marking.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e14314"></a>4.8.3 Cleaning of windows and rooflights</h3></div></div></div><p>Falls account for most window cleaning accidents, and generally occur from
