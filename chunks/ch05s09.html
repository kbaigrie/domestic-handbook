            <p>This standard covers several unrelated safety issues that do not lend
                                       themselves to inclusion in other standards although glass and <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> do figure
                                       prominently.
            </p>
            <p>Collision or entrapment accidents result in a significant numbers of
                                       deaths and injuries to people in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> every year. The majority of
                                       these accidents occur during normal use and involve <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> features
                                       such as doors, windows and areas of fixed glazing, with the risk of injury
                                       increased where vulnerable glass is involved. Collisions with <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> are very common
                                       as it can, if transparent, be difficult to see and may create confusing
                                       lighting effects, presenting particular difficulties for a person with a
                                       visual or cognitive impairment.
            </p>
            <p>Falls still result in deaths and serious injury to people while cleaning
                                       windows. Whether windows are cleaned professionally or by the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> owner,
                                       provision should be made to permit <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazing</a> to be cleaned safely.
            </p>
            <p>Natural ventilation in dwellings is provided by openable windows or
                                       rooflights. People may encounter difficulty and a hazard may arise in
                                       operating controls which are poorly sited. Similarly, location of electrical
                                       sockets, switches and other controls can, if not considered carefully,
                                       affect safe and convenient use.

                                       upstand or rail, positioned approximately 100mm above ground level, to
                                       assist in detection by a visually impaired person using a cane.
            </p>
            <p>There should be visual contrast between guarding rails and surrounding
                                       surfaces. Consideration should be given to positioning of guarding to direct
                                       a person away from the hazard, further reducing the risk of a
                                       collision.
            </p>
            <p>Additional guarding may be needed to prevent collision with, or entrapment
                                       by, a powered door leaf (see clause 4.1.8).
            </p>
            <p>Within a dwelling, guarding is not needed. A door swing may open into a
                                       circulation space provided no obstructions occur within the unobstructed
                                       area on a stair landing (see clause 4.3.6), on a ramp landing or that would
                                       prevent future installation of a stair lift (see clause 4.2.8).

                                       can be difficult to identify and may be a particular hazard to a person with
                                       a visual impairment. Glazing in a building, positioned where accidental
                                       collision may be likely, should be made apparent by some form of
                                       manifestation (marking). Differences in the design of manifestation used can
                                       also assist in identifying the position of doors within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#glazing">glazed</a> screen.

            <p>Manifestation should be of a size and form that is immediately obvious. It
                                       should, as far as is <a class="link" href="apa.html#reasonably_practicable">reasonably practicable</a>, contrast visually

                                       either side. Forms might include broken or solid lines, patterns or logos
                                       and may be a continuous element or at appropriate horizontal intervals.
                                       Manifestation should be present within 2 height ranges, between 850mm and
                                       1.0m, and between 1.4m and 1.6m above floor level. It should be permanent,
                                       e.g. screen printed or opaque etching or a durable applied material which is
                                       not easily removed.

                                       assist in identifying the door edge when opening or in an open position.
                                       This is particularly important on powered doors.
            </p>
            <p>Manifestation or highlighting of door edges need only be provided within
                                       dwellings where glazing installations are unusual. Familiar elements such as
                                       patio doors should not usually attract marking.

                                       followed.

                                       increased risk from a fall should be recognised and guarding provided to a
                                       height of at least 1.1m above floor level.
            </p>
            <p>Where guarding is provided, it should be designed to conform to BS 6180:
                                       2011. All guarding should be permanently fixed and should not be detachable
                                       to permit windows to open. Guarding should be designed so that it is not
                                       easily climbable by young children.
            </p>
            <p>Guarding to a window is not needed where the open window gives access to a
                                       fully guarded balcony.
