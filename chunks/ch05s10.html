            <p>Guidance is given to minimise the risk of explosion due to malfunction of

            <p>It is not intended that this guidance should be applied to storage systems
                                       with a capacity of less than 15 litres, to systems used solely for space
                                       heating or to any system used for an industrial or commercial
                                       process.
            </p>
            <p>Guidance is given on systems of up to 500 litres storage capacity, where
                                       power input does not exceed 45kW. Installations above this size are not
                                       usual in domestic buildings. It is unlikely that many larger installations
                                       will be installed in dwellings but if required, additional guidance on such
                                       installations is provided to Standard 4.9 of the non-domestic Technical
                                       Handbook.

                                       non self-resetting, energy cut-out should be fitted to the vessel. In the
                                       event of thermostat failure, heating to the water in the vessel should stop
                                       before the temperature rises to the critical level required for operation of

            <p>In indirectly heated vessels, the non self-resetting thermal cut-out
                                       should operate a motorised valve, or other similar device, to shut off the
                                       flow from the heat source.
            </p>
            <p>On directly heated vessels or where an indirectly heated vessel has an
                                       alternative direct method of water heating fitted, a non self-resetting
                                       thermal cut-out device should be provided for each direct source.
            </p>
            <p>The safety relief valve should be located directly on the storage vessel.
                                       The relief valve should comform to the relevant national standards such as
                                       BS 6283 Part 2: 1991 for temperature relief valves or BS EN 1490: 2000 for
                                       combined temperature and pressure relief valves which are set to open at
                                       temperatures not normally exceeding 90&ordm;C.
            </p>
            <p>The relief valve should have a discharge capacity rating at least equal to
                                       the rate of energy (power in kilowatts) input to the heat source. In the
                                       case of an indirectly heated unit or package, the valve should be tested to
                                       discharge water at a rate not less than 500kg/h for systems up to 45kW. The
                                       discharge pipework should accommodate this flow rate.

                                       three parts.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Relief valve to tundish</strong></span> - each valve
                                       should discharge into a metal pipe not less than the nominal outlet size of
                                       the valve. The discharge pipe should have an air-break, such as a tundish,
                                       not more than 500mm from the vessel relief valve and located in an easily
                                       visible location within the same enclosure. Discharge pipes from more than
                                       one relief valve may be taken through the same tundish.
            </p>
            <p>Pipework should be installed so that any discharge will be directed away
                                       from electrical components should the discharge outlet become
                                       blocked.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Tundish to final discharge point</strong></span> - the
                                       presence of this air break results in the pressure of the final discharge
                                       being no higher than that of a vented system.
            </p>
            <p>The discharge pipe from the tundish to final discharge point should be of
                                       a material, usually copper, capable of withstanding water temperatures of up
                                       to 95&ordm;C and be at least one pipe size larger than the outlet pipe to the
                                       relief valve. A vertical section of pipe, at least 300mm long, should be
                                       provided beneath the tundish before any bends to the discharge pipe;
                                       thereafter the pipe should be appropriately supported to maintain a
                                       continuous fall of at least 1 in 200 to the discharge point.
            </p>
            <p>The pipework should have a resistance to the flow of water no greater than
                                       that of a straight pipe 9m long unless the pipe bore is increased
                                       accordingly. Guidance on sizing of pipework from the tundish to the final

            <p>Guidance to the Water Byelaws recommends that, to prevent the development
                                       of Legionella or similar pathogens, hot water within a storage vessel should
                                       be stored at a temperature of not less than 60&ordm;C and distributed at a
                                       temperature of not less than 55&ordm;C.
            </p>
            <p>If water is supplied at high temperature from any source, there is a
                                       danger of scalding to <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> users. Risk of severe injury increases proportionally
                                       with increase in temperature and with extent of contact.
            </p>
            <p>To prevent scalding, the temperature of hot water, at point of delivery to
                                       a bath or bidet, should not exceed 48&ordm;C.
            </p>
            <p>A device or system limiting water temperature should not compromise the
                                       principal means of providing protection from the risk of Legionella. It
                                       should allow flexibility in setting of a delivery temperature, up to a
                                       maximum of 48&ordm;C, in a form that is not easily altered by <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> users. This
                                       will allow reduction of temperature where, for example, facilities are used
                                       by those more at risk from injury, such as elderly people or unsupervised
                                       children.
            </p>
            <p>Where both hot and cold water are supplied to a facility, the above may be
                                       achieved by use of a thermostatic mixing valve (TMV) or fitting complying
                                       with BS EN 1111: 1999 or BS EN 1287: 1999, fitted as close to the point of
                                       delivery as practicable. Guidance on the installation, use and maintenance
