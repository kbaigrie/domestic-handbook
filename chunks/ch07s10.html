                                       handed over to the buyer or new tenant. Standard 6.9 ensures the continued
                                       presence of such information for buyers and tenants by also making EPCs
                                       fixtures within <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a>.

            <p>EPCs must be produced in an independent manner and be carried out by
                                       qualified/accredited experts. With the exception of EPCs produced in
                                       relation to a building warrant applied for before 9 January 2013, EPCs must
                                       be produced by members of an Approved Organisation. Scottish Ministers have
                                       appointed a number of Approved Organisations (AO) to deliver certification
                                       services, with each AO following an Operating Framework which is published
                                       on the Building Standards Division website. Information on this framework
                                       and Approved Organisations can be found at <a class="link" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/epc" target="_top">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/epc</a>.

            <p>Scottish Ministers have directed local authorities to apply Standard 6.9

            <p>The EU Directive allows energy performance to be reflected in one or more
                                       numeric indicators. For this to be done in a transparent manner that is
                                       meaningful in terms of Scottish building regulations, the measure to be used
                                       is carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Simplified approach</strong></span> - the certification
                                       must be carried out using the Directive compliant methodology and the
                                       calculation tool which was used to assess compliance with Standard 6.1. In
                                       most cases <a class="link" href="http://www.bre.co.uk/sap2012" target="_top">SAP 2012</a>

                                       However if the simplified approach referred to in clause 6.1.6 has been
                                       adopted for the new <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>, the

                                       individual <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>. For certification
                                       purposes the rating is calculated with the percentage of low energy lighting
                                       and the type of heating as installed. Note, there will be no need to assume

                                       that is worthwhile including is that a <a class="link" href="apa.html#conservatory">conservatory</a> (where one is installed) is only an energy
                                       efficiency benefit to the <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling </a> if it
                                       remains unheated and is not mechanically cooled. 
            </p>
            <p>The recommendations report may give additional advice on protected energy
                                       costs and improvements that are cost-effective only when additional <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> is being carried out e.g. providing
                                       insulation when replacing <a class="link" href="apa.html#flat_roof">flat roof</a>
                                       coverings.
            </p>
            <p>Some experts providing certificates may wish to add extra value and give
                                       additional advice to their clients. All of this is welcome, but in every
                                       case, such information should be clearly explained in the addendum section
                                       of the recommendations report and be accompanied by advice on relevant
                                       warrants and building regulations. Sources of further energy saving advice
                                       and funding options are also noted in the recommendations report.
