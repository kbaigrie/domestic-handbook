            <p>Scottish Water estimate that the average consumption of
                                       wholesome water per person in Scotland is around 150 litres per day.&nbsp; Water
                                       consumption has increased over the last few decades and is projected to
                                       continue to rise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 30% of the average household&#8217;s heating bills are
                                       spent on heating water for sanitary, health or hygiene purposes. Therefore
                                       the provision of sanitary appliances and fittings that use water more
                                       efficiently can assist in the reduction of associated carbon emissions and
                                       the home owner&#8217;s energy costs. &nbsp;

            <p>The Scottish Water Byelaws set requirements which must be adhered to in

                                       installation and maintenance of plumbing systems, water fittings and
                                       water-using appliances. Scottish Water now require all new industrial or
                                       commercial buildings to be metered. Meters may also be installed in <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> if requested. &nbsp;

            <p>The actual water used within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> will
                                       be influenced by both the behaviour of the occupants in how they use the
                                           <a class="link" href="apa.html#sanitary_facility">sanitary facilities</a> and
                                       associated water fittings and also the volume of water discharged from them.
                                       Therefore, controlling the volume of water discharged from <a class="link" href="apa.html#sanitary_facility">sanitary facilities</a> and fittings
                                       should contribute to reducing the use of water. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Efficiency measures can be applied to most <a class="link" href="apa.html#sanitary_facility">sanitary facilities</a> with varying
                                       degrees of benefits. For certain sanitary facilities reducing the water use
                                       will be related to its function.&nbsp;For example a bath is generally filled to a
                                       water level that suits the occupant and therefore controlling water flow
                                       from taps to that facility would only serve to extend the amount of time
                                       taken to fill the bath. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Most WCs produced today are now of the dual flush type which give users
                                       the option of a reduced flush, generally for liquid waste or a full flush
                                       for solid waste. The flush volume will generally be achieved through the
                                       valve mechanism of the WC cistern.  &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>To reduce the water flow rates at taps for wash or hand rinse basins
                                       (WHBs) options include the installation of flow restrictors, or aerators.
                                       These may be fitted in either the water supply pipes serving the sanitary
                                       facilities or incorporated within the tap components.

            <p>Water efficient fittings should be provided to all WCs and WHBs within
                                       a dwelling. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Dual flush WC cisterns should have an <a class="link" href="apa.html#average_flush">average flush</a> volume of not more than 4.5 litres. Single flush
                                       WC cisterns should have a flush volume of not more than 4.5 litres. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Taps serving wash or hand rinse basins should have a flow rate of not more
                                       than 6 litres per minute. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Many bathroom and fittings manufacturers are now using the latest
                                       technology to offer comprehensive portfolios of water efficient products
                                       that deliver satisfactory performance. Further guidance and comparison of
                                       water efficient appliances and fittings for the industry can be obtained
                                       from schemes such as the water efficient product labelling scheme from the
                                       Bathroom Manufacturers Association. &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>When specifying water efficient fittings consideration should be given to
                                       the operational flow rates that some heating or hot water appliances, such
                                       as combination boilers, need to activate their water heating
                                       function.
            </p>
            <p>When installing low volume flush WCs, the pipe diameter, discharge and
                                       gradient inter-relationship of the drainage system is critical in order that
                                       the new and any existing sections of the drain operate as intended.  &nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p>Plumbing and associated water installations should be carried out and
                                       commissioned by persons who possess sufficient technical knowledge, relevant
                                       practical skills and experience for the nature of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> undertaken. &nbsp;
