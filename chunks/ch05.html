               <p>Safety has been defined by the International Standards Organisation as &#8216;a
                                          state of freedom from unacceptable risks of personal harm&#8217;. This recognises
                                          that no activity is absolutely safe or free from risk. No <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> can be
                                          absolutely safe and some risk of harm to users may exist in every <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a>. Building
                                          standards seek to limit risk to an acceptable level by identifying hazards
                                          in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> that can be addressed through the Building (Scotland)
                                          Regulations.
               </p>
               <p>Deaths and serious injury to people in and around <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> occur in
                                          significant numbers from accidents involving falls, collisions, entrapment,
                                          scalding, electrocution or malfunction of fittings. Designers need to
                                          consider all aspects of design carefully to minimise risks inherent in any
                                          building.
               </p>
               <p>Not all issues relating to good practice are covered in this Technical
                                          Handbook. Publications by organisations including the Royal Society for
                                          Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) <a class="link" href="http://www.rospa.com/" target="_top">http://www.rospa.com/</a>
                                          may offer further information relevant to the safety of occupants of, and

               <p><span class="bold"><strong>Accessibility</strong></span> - <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> should be designed to consider

                                          is one within which everyone, regardless of age, disability or circumstance,
                                          can make use of facilities safely, conveniently and without assistance to
                                          the best of their ability. Buildings that consider future flexibility of use
                                          also contribute to the creation of a more sustainable housing stock,
                                          simplifying alterations. This can allow people to remain longer in their
                                          home, through changing circumstances, with the minimum of disruption and
                                          inconvenience.
               </p>
               <p>The guidance in this section, together with the guidance in Section 3,
                                          Environment relating to accessibility, has been based around, and developed
                                          from, issues that are included in &#8216;Housing for Varying Needs&#8217; and the
                                          Lifetime Homes concept developed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

                                          developers are familiar with the use of an access statement as a means of
                                          assisting in the delivery of more inclusive buildings. This records how
                                          access issues have been considered and developed from project inception,
                                          through all stages of development, through to the final use of a
                                          building.
               </p>
               <p>Where design proposals vary from guidance within this Handbook or, in the
                                          case of a conversion where a standard is to be met as far as is reasonably
                                          practicable, relevant information extracted from a project access statement
                                          may assist in determining compliance.

                                          Introducing basic measures to improve security can make unlawful entry into

               <p>The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002 defines
                                          the duties of any party supplying electricity to premises with regard to
                                          matters such as supply, equipment, protection and provision of
                                          earthing.
               </p>
               <p>The Gas Safety (Installations and Use) Regulations 1998 require that any
                                          person who installs, services, maintains, removes, or repairs gas fittings
                                          must be competent. It covers not only materials, workmanship, safety
                                          precautions and testing of gas fittings but also the safe installation of
                                          all aspects of gas-fired combustion appliance installations.

               <p>Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act
                                          2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or construction for
                                          compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                                          approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                                          account of the need to co-ordinate the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> of various designers and specialist
                                          contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under
                                          the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills
                                          and experience required to certify compliance for the <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a> covered by the scope of the scheme.
                                          Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or
                                          installation reliability in accordance with legislation.
