               <p>The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 allows Scottish Ministers to regulate for
                                          the purpose of furthering the achievement of sustainable development. In
                                          Scotland, sustainability is embedded into the building regulations for all
                                          new buildings, rather than reference being made to new buildings<span class="italic"> </span>achieving levels within a voluntary system.
                                          Since 2005, progress has been made by strengthening the standards on, for
                                          example, energy efficiency and accessibility for all new buildings<span class="italic"> </span>so they are comparable with the best in
                                          Europe.
               </p>
               <p>Whilst the standards within Sections 1 - 6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks
                                          deliver a level of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy
                                          efficiency, surface water drainage and sound insulation, there is always the
                                          possibility of going beyond the minimum standard. Scottish Ministers
                                          consider that it is not practicable at this time to require every building
                                          to incorporate higher performance standards or further sustainability
                                          measures. However developers may wish to gain recognition for building to
                                          higher standards. Additionally, organisations such as planning authorities
                                          or funding bodies may choose to make constructing to a higher level of
                                          sustainability a condition of approval or funding. 
               </p>
               <p>Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher
                                          quality buildings to be created and for such benefits to be formally
                                          recognised. The introduction of Section 7 is the next step in encouraging
                                          the sustainable design and construction of all new buildings within a
                                          broader context of sustainable development. Further reductions in carbon
                                          dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from new buildings will also assist in meeting
                                          targets within the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. &nbsp;

                                          related to building design such as material sourcing and embodied energy.
                                          However the Sullivan Report ('A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for
                                          Scotland'; published by Scottish Ministers in 2007) recommends total-life
                                          zero carbon buildings by 2030. This standard can respond in due course to
                                          the growing relative importance of embodied energy as the performance of new
                                          buildings improves further. At present these areas are outside the scope of

               <p><span class="bold"><strong>Aspect</strong></span> is a term used for a subject
                                          area of sustainability. Due to the coverage of building standards and the
                                          position of the warrant process in the overall development process, aspects
                                          covering resource use and performance are more prominent in this standard.
                                          Examples of aspects named and defined in this standard for dwellings are:

               <p>Within the aspect of flexibility and adaptability a &#8216;home
                                          office&#8217; is a space for a desk in a dwelling to allow work or study. A
                                          mobility space is a space that could accommodate an electric wheelchair or
                                          an infant&#8217;s pram or a bicycle.
               </p>
               <p><span class="bold"><strong>Level</strong></span> is the term used as a banding,
                                          where all the aspects of sustainability have reached a certain cut-off
                                          point. Upper levels in some aspects may become absorbed into guidance in
                                          Sections 1 to 6 to meet revised mandatory functional standards following
                                          future reviews of these sections. However, they should not be seen as
                                          predictions because the process for review of these sections are independent
                                          of Section 7. It is possible that levels that are more demanding may be
                                          added into Section 7 in the future.

               <p>Scottish Ministers have powers under Section 25 of the Building (Scotland)

               <p>This power has been used to direct local authorities to apply Section 7 to
                                          buildings that have been assessed by verifiers. This would only be relevant
                                          for buildings that met Sections 1- 6, that have been in force since October

                                          compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are
                                          approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take
                                          account of the need to co-ordinate the work  of various designers and
                                          specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification
                                          services under the scheme are assessed to make sure that they have the
                                          qualifications, skills and experience to certify compliance for the work
                                          covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved
                                          Certifiers will deliver design or installation reliability in accordance
                                          with legislation.

                                          and are used in Scotland. These indicators may be selected as appropriate
                                          for some developments because they cover issues such as location,
                                          orientation on site, or transport that are broader than building regulations
                                          can include. Other established indicators place greater emphasis on the
                                          sourcing and embodied energy of construction  materials, an area flagged up
                                          in this section for future review. Other tools could be complementary in an
                                          assessment of sustainability but they cannot be used as a method to meet an
                                          optional upper level of sustainability within building regulations.
