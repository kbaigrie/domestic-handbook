Asphyxiation
                        caused by smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death. If there is an
                        outbreak of fire within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>, early detection and warning to the occupants can play
                        a vital role in increasing their chances of escape. This is particularly
                        important as the occupants may well be asleep and are more likely to react
                        slower.</p><p>Most fires in <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> are accidental and statistics show that the main
                        sources of ignition are: Cooking appliances, smoking related, candles,
                        electrical supply and other domestic appliances.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Occupant characteristics</strong></span> - in the 4 years
                        2014-2015 to 2017-2018 where fatalities were recorded, on average 30% of
                        fires started in the living room, 17% in bedrooms, and 15% in the kitchen.
                        This means that a significant number of fire related deaths, 62% or 107
                        deaths over the 4 year period, occurred from fires starting in these rooms.
                        It is therefore important that the outbreak of fire in living rooms and
                        kitchens is detected quickly and the alarm raised as early as possible
                        during the early stages of fire growth.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Tolerable Standards</strong></span> - in January 2019
                        amendments to the tolerable standards introduced a requirement for all <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a> to be fitted
                        with heat and smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detection by February 2021.
                        Guidance in support of the tolerable standards calls for interlinked heat
                        and smoke detection to be sited as per the guidance contained in this
                        technical handbook, with the allowance that the installation may be powered
                        by sealed for life battery units. However, where an existing partial or full
                        mains operated heat and smoke detection system is being altered it would
                        normally be expected to replace mains wired devices with mains wired

                        result in the greatest number of fatalities and injuries in Scotland each

                        contribute to the overall number of casualties in Scotland and as a result
