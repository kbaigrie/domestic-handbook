                                       supports the Scottish Government's aim of promoting a more inclusive built
                                       environment and will better address the changing needs of occupants over

                                       absorbs lead easily from drinking water and this can have a negative effect
                                       on the intellectual development of young children. Although mains water
                                       supplies do not contain significant levels of lead, recent research studies
                                       have shown that leaded solder plumbing fittings, normally used for heating
                                       systems, have been used on drinking water pipework in contravention of the
