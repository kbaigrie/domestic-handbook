            <p>Circulation areas within a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should allow occupants to move
                                       around freely and without difficulty, to the best of their ability. Lack of
                                       space can make movement around a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> difficult for many people and
                                       hamper activities such as carrying or moving large items.
            </p>
            <p>The design process should consider how the building can be used by as wide
                                       a range of people as possible, including use by a person in a wheelchair,
                                       though it is recognised that this may not be to the optimum standard that
                                       can be achieved within purpose-built dwellings.
            </p>
            <p>Improvement to circulation within dwellings under this standard, together
                                       with the provision, on one level, of an enhanced apartment, and kitchen
                                       (Standard 3.11) and accessible sanitary accommodation (Standard 3.12) will
                                       assist in creating more sustainable homes.

            <p>Whilst the guidance to this standard reflects general good practice,
                                       certain issues remain outwith the scope of the building regulations. There
                                       are numerous publications offering additional guidance on accessibility and

                                       allow all dwellings on upper storeys to be reached from a common entrance
                                       level. However it is recognised that it may not always be reasonably
                                       practicable to provide lift access within all domestic buildings.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, a building containing flats or maisonettes may be constructed
                                       without a passenger lift where not more than 4 storeys in height and where
                                       there is no dwelling with a principal living level at more than 10m above
                                       either a common entrance level or the level of the lowest storey.
            </p>
            <p>In any building above this height, or where there are communal facilities
                                       on a level other than a common entrance level, there should be a means of
                                       unassisted access. This should serve each level of the building that
                                       contains a common entrance, an entrance to a dwelling or communal
                                       facilities. Unassisted access between storeys should be by passenger lift,
                                       with the installation meeting the recommendations of BS EN 81-70:
                                       2003.
            </p>
            <p>Any passenger lift should be designed and installed to include the

                                       levels of a dwelling are not accessible to some occupants. Guidance
                                       elsewhere considers situations where occupants, incapacitated for a short
                                       period of time, might live within one storey. However this is not generally
                                       appropriate for longer term illness or infirmity, where a more permanent,
                                       inclusive, solution is required.
            </p>
            <p>Provision should be made for future installation of a means of unassisted
                                       access, both within a storey and between storeys.
