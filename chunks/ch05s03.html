                        around freely and without difficulty, to the best of their ability. Lack of
                        space can make movement around a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> difficult for many people and
                        hamper activities such as carrying or moving large items.</p><p>The design process should consider how the building can be used by as wide
                        a range of people as possible, including use by a person in a wheelchair,
                        though it is recognised that this may not be to the optimum standard that
                        can be achieved within purpose-built dwellings.</p><p>Improvement to circulation within dwellings under this standard, together
                        with the provision, on one level, of an enhanced apartment, and kitchen
                        (Standard 3.11) and accessible sanitary accommodation (Standard 3.12) will
                        assist in creating more sustainable homes.</p><p>Whilst the guidance to this standard reflects general good practice,
                        certain issues remain outwith the scope of the building regulations. There
                        are numerous publications offering additional guidance on accessibility and
