            <p>An inclusive approach to design should be taken to ensure that <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> are as
                                       accessible to as wide a range of people as possible. Solutions should be
                                       integral to a design rather than an afterthought added in order to meet
                                       duties under building standards or other legislation.

                                       buildings. It applies throughout any internal or external environment,
                                       wherever people go about everyday activities. It should be a continuous
                                       process, through all stages of the development of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> and involve
                                       potential users. Advice on this topic is available in the joint BSD/Scottish
                                       Executive Planning Division Planning Advice Note PAN 78: &#8216;Inclusive Design&#8217;

                                       then be able to travel conveniently and without assistance to an entrance of
                                       a building. Routes to a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> that are too steep, too narrow or poorly surfaced, or
                                       that contain steps or other obstructions, will make access difficult or
                                       impossible for many people. To prevent this, a route to an entrance should
                                       be provided that is accessible to everyone.
            </p>

                                       impairment and should be located outwith the width of an accessible route.
                                       Use of low-level bollards or chain-linked posts, for example, can be

                                       intervals dependent on the gradient of the sloping surface. This should

            <p>Recommendations for ramps are provided in the guidance to Standard

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Complementary steps</strong></span> - ramps are not
                                       necessarily safe or convenient for an ambulant person with mobility
                                       impairment, and can be more difficult and dangerous to negotiate than steps.
                                       Therefore, on a route serving more than 1 dwelling, any ramped access,
                                       having a rise of more than 300mm, should be complemented by an alternate,
                                       stepped means of access.
            </p>
            <p>There may be stepped access to a route serving a single house where it is
                                       not reasonably practicable to construct an accessible route, such as on a
                                       steeply sloping site. As a guideline, if a ramp to an accessible entrance
                                       can be formed within the curtilage of the dwelling with one change in
                                       direction between the bottom of the ramp and the top landing, access should
                                       be considered reasonably practicable.
            </p>
            <p>Where an accessible route cannot be provided from a road, it may still be
                                       practicable to construct an accessible route by providing a car parking
                                       space within the curtilage of the dwelling. It is only where it is not
                                       reasonably practicable to construct an accessible route from either a road
                                       or from car parking within the curtilage of the dwelling that a stepped
                                       access solution may be proposed.

                                       in manoeuvring. It should provide a degree of traction that will minimise

                                       relevant to the material, where such exists.
            </p>
            <p>Surface elements such as drainage gratings and manhole covers should be of
                                       a type that will not create a trip or entrapment hazard. Uneven surfaces,
                                       such as cobbles, or loose-laid materials, such as gravel, will present
                                       difficulties to many people and should not be used.

            <p>Where a dwelling does not have an accessible entrance, one need not be
                                       provided to the existing dwelling, or to the extension, as this will not
                                       result in the building failing to meet the standard to a greater
                                       degree.
            </p>
            <p>Where an accessible entrance exists, any works should ensure that the
                                       existing entrance remains accessible. If this is not possible, a new
                                       accessible entrance should be provided elsewhere into the dwelling. Such an
                                       entrance should also maintain accessibility within the dwelling, as set out
                                       in guidance to Standard 4.2.
