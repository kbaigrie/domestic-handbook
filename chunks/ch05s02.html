                        follow the same relationship given for ramp flights, e.g. up to 20m apart
                        for a slope of 1 in 30, 30m for a slope of 1 in 40 and so on.</p><p>Recommendations for ramps are provided in the guidance to Standard

                        Therefore, on a route serving more than 1 <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>, any ramped access, having a
                        rise of more than 300mm, should be complemented by an alternate, stepped

                        not reasonably practicable to construct an accessible route, such as on a
                        steeply sloping site. As a guideline, if a ramp to an accessible entrance
                        can be formed within the curtilage of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> with one change in direction

                        practicable to construct an accessible route by providing a car parking
                        space within the curtilage of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>. It is only where it is not
                        reasonably practicable to construct an accessible route from either a road

                        the possibility of slipping. This should take into account both anticipated
                        use and environmental conditions.</p><p>The surface of an accessible route, whether composed of modular paving
                        units, formless materials such as tarmac, or another durable material,
                        should have a profile that will not offer a trip hazard or result in
                        standing water. It should be installed in accordance with a code of practice
                        relevant to the material, where such exists.</p><p>Surface elements such as drainage gratings and manhole covers should be of
                        a type that will not create a trip or entrapment hazard. Uneven surfaces,
                        such as cobbles, or loose-laid materials, such as gravel, will present

                        impairment of the presence of a vehicular route. This need not apply to a
                        route within the curtilage of a single <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a>. Information on use of tactile

                        as recommended in clause 4.1.3, the length of an accessible route to an
                        accessible entrance of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should be limited to 45m.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e13153"></a>4.1.6 Width of accessible routes</h3></div></div></div><p>The width of a pedestrian route to a <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> should reflect how it will be
                        used. For example, most public footpaths are at least 1.8m wide, which
                        allows two-way traffic under most circumstances.</p><p>The clear and unobstructed surface width of an accessible route should
                        generally be at least 1.8m, unless:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>giving access to not more than 10 <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwellings</a>, where the minimum
