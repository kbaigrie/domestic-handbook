                        substantially over the last decade. This is mainly as a result of people&#8217;s
                        changing lifestyles, greater numbers and use of sound-producing equipment
                        and household appliances.</p><p>There has been a dramatic increase in the use of electrical goods,
                        particularly sound producing equipment such as audio and TV. Music can be
                        more bass orientated and played at higher volumes, whilst speakers mounted
                        on walls may improve the quality to the listener, they can create a
                        disturbance to others. The intention is not to prevent all sound from being
                        heard, but to limit noise nuisance by achieving levels of sound insulation
                        that will help to reduce the effects of sound on people in their
                        home.</p><p>Complaints regarding noisy services do occur. Dealing with the varying
                        levels of sound produced by service equipment, such as lifts, heat pumps or
                        air conditioning units in <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">buildings</a> is a complex task. Guidance is given on the care that
                        should be taken at the design stage in the choice of service equipment,
                        installation and location within the building.</p><p>Designers should be aware that some Local Authorities may also set noise
                        reduction targets. This is usually enforced through environmental health and
                        planning legislation for noise emanating from commercial premises to
                        dwellings, and more information on this is contained in PAN 1/2011.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a> as

                        Listed buildings can be obtained from the Building Performance Centre,
                        Napier University booklet 'Housing and Sound Insulation &#8211; Improving existing
                        attached dwellings and designing for conversions' <a class="link" href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/built-environment/building/building-standards" target="_top">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/built-environment/building/building-standards</a>.</p><p>The conversion of a roof space into a habitable area, although very
                        common, can present problems as it is unlikely that access to the roof space
                        in the adjoining dwelling can be assured. Where an existing separating wall
                        in a roof space is constructed of a single leaf of masonry only, it would be
                        appropriate to provide one leaf of a free-standing framed construction next
                        to the existing wall as each attic is developed. Example Constructions -
                        detail 3: timber frame twin stud wall; gives a typical arrangement.</p><p>The building owner may wish to carry out a pre-conversion sound test prior
                        to the start of any conversion, ideally during the building survey process.
                        The acoustic performance of the existing construction can then be
                        established and problems identified that will allow the design of a tailored
                        acoustic solution to be determined at an early stage.</p><p>For larger or more complex <a class="link" href="apa.html#work">work</a>, advice on <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a> may be sought from an acoustic specialist who should
                        be able to offer appropriate design guidance.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e15353"></a>5.1.6 Doors in a separating wall</h3></div></div></div><p>A door in a separating wall dividing a dwelling from a common area of a
                        building can create an acoustic weak point in the wall allowing unwelcome
                        noise into the dwelling. As entrance doors to dwellings from common areas
                        must comply with the relevant standards in Section 2: Fire, Section 4:
                        Safety and Section 6: Energy the doorset will be relatively robust, and the
                        weakest point for noise to enter the dwelling will be through the gap
                        between the door frame and the door.</p><p>Entrance doors to flats and maisonettes located in a separating wall
                        should be fitted with a perimeter seal, including the threshold, to minimise
                        noise transmittance through the doorset.</p><p>A compressible type of seal may be used such as a rubber strip. Where the
                        seal is of a type that combines a smoke and noise seal, the product
                        literature should be consulted to confirm the seal will achieve the desired
                        effect. The seal should not interfere with the closing mechanisms of a fire
                        door and provide a positive seal between the door frame and the door.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e15358"></a>5.1.7 Noise from services</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">Building</a> service

                        equipment such as lift rails should be isolated from the walls and floor to
                        reduce vibrations and the resulting sound transmission to <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">rooms</a> intended for

                        adjacent one-third-octave bands should be not more than 6dB. If this
                        condition is not met, the source spectrum should be adjusted and the source

                        repeated. If the condition is met, the average sound pressure level in the

                        the output level of the sound source, once its spectrum has been correctly
                        adjusted (where necessary).</p><p>The sound source should now be moved to the next position in the source
                            <a class="link" href="apa.html#room">room</a> and the above
                        procedure repeated to determine another level difference. At least two
                        positions should be used for the source. The level differences obtained from
                        each source position should be arithmetically averaged, D as defined in BS

                        made if a test is needed for such a separating wall as the door will not
                        achieve the same 'design performance level' as a separating wall, as the
