                        of an object. It is important to avoid hazardous situations that may be
                        created by the nature of the lighting itself including insufficient light
                        sources, glare, gloom and shadows.</p><p>During daylight, lighting levels within a building are generally much less
                        than those outdoors. In lobby areas, transitional lighting will assist the
                        eye in adjusting quickly between exterior and interior lighting conditions.
                        Careful design of lighting can also play an important part in emergency
                        situations, to ensure the safe and effective evacuation of people in an
                        emergency.</p><p>Section 2 (Fire) includes guidance on escape route lighting and emergency
                        lighting, whilst Section 6 (Energy) covers energy efficient design of
                        lighting.</p><p>Aside from the specific issues noted above and in guidance to this
                        standard, general guidance on lighting in buildings remains outwith the
                        scope of the Technical Handbook. There are, however numerous publications
                        offering guidance on use of lighting in buildings for safety and amenity,
                        including those listed below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Code for Lighting &#8211; CIBSE (2002)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Building Sight - Royal National Institute for the Blind
                                    (1995).</p></li></ul></div><p>The provision of an entryphone system to a communal entrance will enhance
                        both the amenity and the security of occupants within a building.</p><p>Today, with ever more electrical appliances being used in homes, an
                        adequate provision of power points reduces the possibility of both
                        overloading of individual sockets, risking fire, and the creation of trip
                        hazards from use of extension cabling.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a>, as
                        specified in regulation 4, the building as converted shall meet the
                        requirement of this standard (regulation 12, schedule 6).</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e14153"></a>4.6.1 Lighting</h3></div></div></div><p>A dwelling should have an electric lighting system providing at least one
                        lighting point to every circulation space, kitchen, bathroom, toilet and
                        other space having a floor area of 2m<sup>2</sup> or
                        more.</p><p>Any lighting point serving a stair should have controlling switches at, or
                        in the immediate vicinity of, the stair landing on each storey.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e14158"></a>4.6.2 Lighting in common areas of domestic buildings</h3></div></div></div><p>In communal areas and particularly on stairs and ramps within a building,
                        the possibility of slips, trips and falls and of collision with obstacles
                        should be minimised. Lighting conditions play an important part in
                        this.</p><p>Common areas should have artificial lighting capable of providing a
                        uniform lighting level, at floor level, of not less than 100 lux on stair
                        flights and landings and 50 lux elsewhere within circulation areas. Lighting
                        should not present sources of glare and should avoid creation of areas of
                        strong shadow that may cause confusion or miss-step. A means of automatic
                        control should be provided to ensure that lighting is operable during the
                        hours of darkness.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e14162"></a>4.6.3 Door entry systems</h3></div></div></div><p>Entry to buildings containing flats or maisonettes is controlled to
                        maintain the security of a private space and to prevent vandalism.
                        Similarly, the principal entrance to a sheltered housing complex may have an
                        access control system for the general security and safety of
                        residents.</p><p>A common entrance door, intended as a principal means of access to a
                        building, should have a door entry system installed. This should comprise of
                        a remote door release and intercom at the point of entry and a call unit
                        within each dwelling served by that entrance.</p><p>Any unit at a common entrance should be positioned between 900mm and 1.2m
                        above floor level. It should include an inductive coupler compatible with
                        the &#8216;T&#8217; setting on a personal hearing aid, together with a visual indicator
                        that a call made has been received. Controls should contrast visually with
                        surrounding surfaces and any numeric keypad should follow the 12-button
                        telephone convention, with an embossed locater to the central &#8216;5&#8217;

                        with the increase in use of electrical appliances. Connection of multiple
                        appliances into a socket outlet through an adapter can lead to overheating
                        and the risk of fire. Similarly, use of extension leads can create a trip
                        hazard.</p><p>To reduce these risks, a dwelling should be provided with at least the
                        following number of 13A socket outlets:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>4 within each apartment, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>6 within the kitchen, at least 3 of which should be situated
                                    above worktop level in addition to any outlets provided for
                                    floor-standing white goods or built-in appliances, and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>an additional 4 anywhere in the dwelling, including at least 1
                                    within each circulation area on a level or storey.</p></li></ul></div><p>Sockets may be installed as single or double outlets, to give the
