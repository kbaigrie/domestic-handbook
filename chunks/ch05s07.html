            <p>Visual perception increases with the level of light falling on the surface
                                       of an object. It is important to avoid hazardous situations that may be
                                       created by the nature of the lighting itself including insufficient light
                                       sources, glare, gloom and shadows.
            </p>
            <p>During daylight, lighting levels within a building are generally much less
                                       than those outdoors. In lobby areas, transitional lighting will assist the
                                       eye in adjusting quickly between exterior and interior lighting conditions.
                                       Careful design of lighting can also play an important part in emergency
                                       situations, to ensure the safe and effective evacuation of people in an
                                       emergency.
            </p>
            <p>Section 2 (Fire) includes guidance on escape route lighting and emergency
                                       lighting, whilst Section 6 (Energy) covers energy efficient design of
                                       lighting.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from the specific issues noted above and in guidance to this
                                       standard, general guidance on lighting in buildings remains outwith the
                                       scope of the Technical Handbook. There are, however numerous publications
                                       offering guidance on use of lighting in buildings for safety and amenity,
                                       including those listed below:

                                       adequate provision of power points reduces the possibility of both
                                       overloading of individual sockets, risking fire, and the creation of trip
                                       hazards from use of extension cabling.

                                       other space having a floor area of 2m<sup>2</sup> or

                                       the possibility of slips, trips and falls and of collision with obstacles
                                       should be minimised. Lighting conditions play an important part in
                                       this.
            </p>
            <p>Common areas should have artificial lighting capable of providing a
                                       uniform lighting level, at floor level, of not less than 100 lux on stair
                                       flights and landings and 50 lux elsewhere within circulation areas. Lighting
                                       should not present sources of glare and should avoid creation of areas of
                                       strong shadow that may cause confusion or miss-step. A means of automatic
                                       control should be provided to ensure that lighting is operable during the
                                       hours of darkness.

                                       Similarly, the principal entrance to a sheltered housing complex may have an

            <p>Current lifestyle places a greater demand on electrical installations,
                                       with the increase in use of electrical appliances. Connection of multiple
                                       appliances into a socket outlet through an adapter can lead to overheating
                                       and the risk of fire. Similarly, use of extension leads can create a trip

            </p>
            <p>To reduce these risks, a dwelling should be provided with at least the
