               </div>
            </div>
            <p> The QSG should be specific to each individual dwelling. Where there are a
                                       number of houses or flats of the same type, it is likely that the
                                       information could be repeated for each type, taking care to ensure correct
                                       orientation of plans and correct positions of installed items on the plan. 
            </p>
            <p>The purpose is not to explain details of how or why a home is designed to
                                       work environmentally, but rather what occupiers need to know to make a home
                                       work efficiently. It should describe the overall performance of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> as a system itself. The focus should
                                       be on maintaining internal comfort in an efficient manner. Do not include
                                       unnecessary detail on the operation of the individual elements or systems of
                                       technology.

            <p>The QSG should be as compact and graphic as possible to aid rapid
                                       comprehension, making it more likely to be kept available, used for future
                                       reference and be capable of being passed on to future owners or residents. 
            </p>
            <p>A variety of formats could be used to convey the information but it should
                                       be a free-standing document, separate from other documentation (but
                                       including directions to further information). It may be designed to meet a
                                       similar graphic standard of other material which is provided at completion.
                                       The recommended formats are:

            </div>
            <p>The QSG should include plans, locating key items of equipment and
                                       information only on the systems installed. The format should revolve around
                                       simple illustrations following the principle &#8211; &#8216;show don&#8217;t tell&#8217;. An
                                       illustration can be a hand-drawn sketch, a computer image or a photograph.
                                       These can be mixed because consistency in style is less important than
                                       content. Illustrations do not need to be to scale, but should show
                                       relationships and explain things quickly and easily. These guidelines should
                                       be followed:

            </p>
            <p>a) Overview </p>
            <p>Give a brief description of the basic features of the house, including
                                       insulation, building fabric, heating, ventilation, hot water use and any
                                       major equipment that make a difference to how the house operates. Avoid
                                       large paragraphs. Keep to between 100 to 150 words. 
            </p>
            <p>The overview page should include the following sentence: This guide is
                                       produced to meet the aspect of  'Optimising Performance' within Section 7:
                                       Sustainability of the Building Standards Technical Handbooks. 
            </p>
            <p>Locate key parts of the equipment, annotated on a legible plan or other
                                       illustration. Plans should be simple and clear, generally &#8216;planning
                                       application&#8217; standard with walls blacked in, dimensions and unnecessary
                                       annotation removed in the CAD program. Showing fittings such as bathrooms
                                       and <a class="link" href="apa.html#kitchen">kitchens</a> on layouts can assist.
                                       Limitations on alterations due to the construction (e.g. avoid holes in
                                       external walls that penetrate the vapour barrier) can be mentioned here. Use
                                       3D plan perspectives, axonometric diagrams, or cutaway models to aid
                                       understanding. Items to be shown include:

            <p>b) Heating </p>
            <p>Describe how the home can be heated including aspects of the building
                                       fabric and ventilation that are relevant to how the system works. Cover the
                                       main principles of use in both warm and cold weather. Simple diagrams
                                       illustrating how the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is heated in
                                       both winter and summer are useful. Avoid engineering heating system
                                       schematics as many people find these hard to understand.
            </p>
            <p>Describe in around 50-100 words the main heating source in the home,
                                       including the principles of operation and fuel source if relevant.
                                       Supplementary heating sources should be mentioned, where included. Provide a
                                       brief description of how heat reaches rooms e.g. radiators, underfloor
                                       heating, air grilles, with illustrations provided as required.
            </p>
            <p>Briefly describe how heating is controlled. Illustrations and locations
                                       are required for all the main controls. Identify the reaction to heating
                                       controls (for example there may be a time lag before a heating system
                                       operates at optimum capacity) and outline the normal range if this is not
                                       obvious.
            </p>
            <p>c) Ventilation </p>
            <p>Describe in around 50-100 words how the home is ventilated and the main
                                       principles for its use, in both warm and cold weather. Simple diagrams
                                       illustrating how the <a class="link" href="apa.html#buildings">building</a> is ventilated
                                       in winter and summer are useful.
            </p>
            <p>Briefly describe how the ventilation is controlled with illustrations and
                                       locations required for all the main controls. This should include both
                                       natural and mechanical systems. Identify the elements that users have the
                                       most interaction with, so in natural ventilation, it may be trickle vents
                                       and opening of windows together with a reference to cross ventilation. For
                                       mechanical ventilation it may be the boost switch and location of
                                       filters.
            </p>
            <p>d) Hot Water </p>
            <p>Provide up to 50-100 words on how water is heated in the homes, including
                                       primary and secondary systems (for example a boiler working with solar hot
                                       water panels). Consider a simple diagram illustrating how the system works
                                       if it has a number of components or options.
            </p>
            <p>Briefly describe how hot water generation is controlled. Illustrate the
                                       controls, identify the reaction to hot water controls (for example there may
                                       be a time lag before a hot water system operates at optimum capacity) and
                                       outline the normal range if this is not obvious.
            </p>
            <p>e) Other Energy Saving Features (if installed)</p>
            <p>Cover any other energy saving feature installed as part of the fabric of
                                       the home or included in the SAP calculation. Include instructions for items
                                       not covered elsewhere. Each item should have a brief (around 50
                                       words).
            </p>
            <p>description of other energy saving features. Identify for each
