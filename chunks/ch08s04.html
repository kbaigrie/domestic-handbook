                        number of houses or flats of the same type, it is likely that the
                        information could be repeated for each type, taking care to ensure correct
                        orientation of plans and correct positions of installed items on the plan. </p><p>The purpose is not to explain details of how or why a home is designed to
                        work environmentally, but rather what occupiers need to know to make a home
                        work efficiently. It should describe the overall performance of the <a class="link" href="apa.html#dwelling">dwelling</a> as a system itself. The focus should
                        be on maintaining internal comfort in an efficient manner. Do not include
                        unnecessary detail on the operation of the individual elements or systems of
                        technology. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e19067"></a>7.B.2 Format</h3></div></div></div><p>The QSG should be as compact and graphic as possible to aid rapid
                        comprehension, making it more likely to be kept available, used for future
                        reference and be capable of being passed on to future owners or residents. </p><p>A variety of formats could be used to convey the information but it should
                        be a free-standing document, separate from other documentation (but
                        including directions to further information). It may be designed to meet a
                        similar graphic standard of other material which is provided at completion.
                        The recommended formats are: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p> an A4 guide of maximum 6 pages, preferably 4 or less or
                                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a booklet with page sizes smaller than A4, possibly with double page
                                spreads such as the booklet in the first good practice example.</p></li></ul></div><p>Better design and construction of control mechanisms should make systems
                           more intuitive and reduce the need for guidance, therefore please be very
                           concise if appropriate.

                        information only on the systems installed. The format should revolve around
                        simple illustrations following the principle &#8211; &#8216;show don&#8217;t tell&#8217;. An
                        illustration can be a hand-drawn sketch, a computer image or a photograph.
                        These can be mixed because consistency in style is less important than
                        content. Illustrations do not need to be to scale, but should show
                        relationships and explain things quickly and easily. These guidelines should
                        be followed: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Use illustration where possible to focus the occupant on the

                                    example, the programmer in the heating section should show where

                                    sizes is used. Make headings as large as possible</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Use clear, colour, photographs (well lit, avoid use of flash if possible) or line

                                    further information. The main elements or products should be
                                    identified with their full names/reference model numbers and

                                    system) is used because the acronym is more likely to lead to

                        major equipment that make a difference to how the house operates. Avoid
                        large paragraphs. Keep to between 100 to 150 words. </p><p>The overview page should include the following sentence: This guide is

                        including the principles of operation and fuel source if relevant.
                        Supplementary heating sources should be mentioned, where included. Provide a
                        brief description of how heat reaches rooms e.g. radiators, underfloor

                        in winter and summer are useful.</p><p>Briefly describe how the ventilation is controlled with illustrations and
                        locations required for all the main controls. This should include both
                        natural and mechanical systems. Identify the elements that users have the
                        most interaction with, so in natural ventilation, it may be trickle vents
                        and opening of windows together with a reference to cross ventilation. For
                        mechanical ventilation it may be the boost switch and location of
                        filters.</p><p>d) Hot Water </p><p>Provide up to 50-100 words on how water is heated in the homes, including
                        primary and secondary systems (for example a boiler working with solar hot
                        water panels). Consider a simple diagram illustrating how the system works
                        if it has a number of components or options.</p><p>Briefly describe how hot water generation is controlled. Illustrate the
                        controls, identify the reaction to hot water controls (for example there may
                        be a time lag before a hot water system operates at optimum capacity) and
                        outline the normal range if this is not obvious.</p><p>e) Other Energy Saving Features (if installed)</p><p>Cover any other energy saving feature installed as part of the fabric of
                        the home or included in the SAP calculation. Include instructions for items
