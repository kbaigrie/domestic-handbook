            <p>Half of all accidents involving falls within and around buildings occur on
                                       stairways, with young children and elderly people being particularly at
                                       risk. This risk can be greatly reduced by ensuring that any change in level
                                       incorporates basic precautions to guard against accident and falls.
            </p>
            <p>Stairs and ramps should be constructed to be within limits recognised as
                                       offering safe and convenient passage and designed so that any person who is
                                       likely to use them can do so comfortably and safely, with the minimum amount
                                       of difficulty. Design should also address the issue of appropriate guarding,
                                       where a level change is made, and seek to eliminate any possible trip
                                       hazards.

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Explanation of terms</strong></span></p>
            <p>The following terms are explained to provide clarity to their meaning in
                                       the Technical Handbooks.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Private stair</strong></span> means a stair wholly within
                                       a dwelling. It may also apply to any stair within the curtilage of a single
                                       dwelling, which is not accessible to the public. This might include, for
                                       example, a stair from a dwelling to a private garden, or a stair providing
                                       access to or within a domestic garage. It should not, however include any
                                       external stair that forms a part of an accessible route to the
                                       dwelling.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Tapered tread</strong></span> means a stair tread in
                                       which the nosing is not parallel to the nosing of the tread or landing next
                                       above.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Conversions</strong></span> - in the case of <a class="link" href="apa.html#convert">conversions</a> as
                                       specified in regulation 4, the building as converted shall meet the
                                       requirements of this standard in so far as is reasonably practicable, and in
                                       no case be worse than before the conversion (regulation 12, schedule
                                       6).

            <p>The act of climbing stairs can be tiring to many people. Whilst landings
                                       can provide a safe resting point, the <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> itself is not intended to do so.
                                       The maximum number of rises between landings should therefore be
                                       limited.
            </p>
            <p>Generally, a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a>
                                       should have not more than 16 rises.
            </p>
            <p>Below a minimum number of steps, it becomes difficult to signal a change
                                       of level, which can contribute significantly to a trip hazard.
            </p>
            <p>Generally, a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a>
                                       should have at least 3 rises.

            </p>
            <p>Open risers on a <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> can be a hazard. When ascending a stair, people may be at
                                       risk of trapping the toes of shoes beneath projecting nosings, and of
                                       tripping as a result. In addition, many may feel a sense of insecurity when
                                       looking through spaces present between treads.
            </p>
            <p>A stair should have contrasting nosings to assist in identifying the
                                       position of treads and risers should be profiled to minimise tripping as
                                       shown below. Open rises should not be used unless a stair is intended for

            <p>The width of a ramp should relate to the intensity of use. For example, an
                                       unobstructed width of 1.8m is the minimum that will allow two wheelchair
                                       users to pass safely. As a ramp <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> will normally be enclosed between
                                       flanking handrails or guarding, it is important that this width still offers
                                       safe and convenient passage.
            </p>
            <p>The effective width of a ramp <a class="link" href="apa.html#flight">flight</a> should be at least 1.0m. Effective
                                       width is measured between handrails, or where there are no handrails, the
                                       protective barrier or inside face of any wall or guarding kerb, and should
                                       be clear of any obstructions.
