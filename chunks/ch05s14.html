            <p>Whilst police statistics show signs of housebreaking decreasing since
                                       1999, people&#8217;s perception of their likelihood of falling victim to this type
                                       of crime continues to increase. The 2003 Scottish Crime Survey identified
                                       that one in ten people consider it &#8216;very&#8217; or &#8216;fairly&#8217; likely that their home
                                       would be broken into within the next twelve months. This is an increase on
                                       the same response in 2000 and is double the proportion of households who
                                       were actually victims of housebreaking in preceding years.
            </p>
            <p>As almost half of the recorded incidents of housebreaking occur when a
                                       property is occupied, it is not surprising that housebreaking is rated
                                       amongst the crimes that cause people most concern and worry. However basic
                                       measures to improve the physical security of dwellings, including robust
                                       specification of doors, windows, glazing and locks, can act deter the
                                       opportunist thief.
            </p>
            <p>Guidance to other standards is also relevant to promoting a more secure
                                       environment as follows:

            <p>&#8216;Secured by Design&#8217; is the established police initiative to design out
                                       elements within development that may contribute to housebreaking and other
                                       crimes. &#8216;Secured by Design&#8217; accreditation considers site design and layout
                                       as well as physical security measures and offers a more comprehensive
                                       solution than those physical provisions set out within this standard. As
                                       &#8216;Secured by Design&#8217; is assessed on a site-specific basis, the police can
                                       also offer recommendations on appropriate additional measures in areas where
                                       the risk of crimes, such as housebreaking, are considered greater.

            <p>The two most common means of unlawful entry into a dwelling are through

                                       open. The level of security of any dwelling can be significantly enhanced by
                                       ensuring that all external doors and any windows or glazing in vulnerable
                                       locations are manufactured and installed to resist forced entry and also

                                                            material.

            <p>Where a material standard for a doorset is not available, it should be
                                       designed and constructed in accordance with the recommendations in Annex A
                                       of BS 8220-1: 2000, together with the following recommendations, to ensure a
                                       robust basic standard of security.
            </p>
            <p>If single swing the doorset should be fitted with at least one and a half
                                       pairs of hinges meeting the recommendations of BS EN 1935: 2002 for hinge
                                       grade 11 or above. Hinges fitted to an outward-opening door should be of a
                                       type that does not permit the hinge pin to be removed unless the door is
                                       open. Otherwise, hinge bolts should be fitted to ensure the door leaf will
                                       remain secure when closed.
            </p>
            <p>A doorset should include a single-point locking device to BS 3621: 2007
                                       (for keyed egress) or to BS 8621: 2007 (for keyless egress) or a multipoint
                                       locking system. A deadlocking facility should be provided. Any lock cylinder
                                       should be in accordance with BS EN 1303: 2005, grade 5 key security and
                                       grade 2 attack resistance as a minimum.
            </p>
            <p>To limit unauthorised access, a communal entrance door fitted with an
                                       access control system (see clause 4.6.3) should be self-closing and
                                       self-locking, with keyless operation of any lock from within the common
                                       area. To accommodate access control systems, a doorset may incorporate
                                       electronic or magnetic remote release and a means of access which includes
                                       keyless electronic solutions (keypad, proximity swipe, etc).
            </p>
            <p>Access to door locks from outside by breaking of glazing, in or adjacent
                                       to a door leaf should be prevented by use of laminated glass or a similarly
                                       robust glazing material.
            </p>
            <p>A sliding door should have a multi-point deadlocking system with 3 or more
                                       hook or similar bolts. To prevent removal of the door, an anti-lift device
                                       should be fitted. Shoot bolts, if used, should locate into the head of the
                                       frame.
            </p>
            <p>A doorset with more than one door leaf should include a means of securing
                                       any secondary leaf at head and foot to allow the primary leaf to be securely
                                       locked.

                                       designed to resist normal anticipated loads, such as from wind and
                                       accidental impact, will also ensure that a doorset or window is secure
