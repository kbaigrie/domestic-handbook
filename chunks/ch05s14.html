                        1999, people&#8217;s perception of their likelihood of falling victim to this type
                        of crime continues to increase. The 2003 Scottish Crime Survey identified
                        that one in ten people consider it &#8216;very&#8217; or &#8216;fairly&#8217; likely that their home
                        would be broken into within the next twelve months. This is an increase on
                        the same response in 2000 and is double the proportion of households who
                        were actually victims of housebreaking in preceding years.</p><p>As almost half of the recorded incidents of housebreaking occur when a
                        property is occupied, it is not surprising that housebreaking is rated
                        amongst the crimes that cause people most concern and worry. However basic
                        measures to improve the physical security of dwellings, including robust
                        specification of doors, windows, glazing and locks, can act deter the
                        opportunist thief.</p><p>Guidance to other standards is also relevant to promoting a more secure
                        environment as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>lighting of common entrances and dwelling entrances (Standard

                        elements within development that may contribute to housebreaking and other
                        crimes. &#8216;Secured by Design&#8217; accreditation considers site design and layout
                        as well as physical security measures and offers a more comprehensive
                        solution than those physical provisions set out within this standard. As
                        &#8216;Secured by Design&#8217; is assessed on a site-specific basis, the police can
                        also offer recommendations on appropriate additional measures in areas where
                        the risk of crimes, such as housebreaking, are considered greater.

                        doors or windows, where these are either left open or can be easily forced
                        open. The level of security of any dwelling can be significantly enhanced by
                        ensuring that all external doors and any windows or glazing in vulnerable
                        locations are manufactured and installed to resist forced entry and also
                        that unauthorised entry into common areas is prevented.</p><p>Doors should be designed and installed to resist forced entry at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>an external door to a dwelling or common area of a <a class="link" href="apa.html#domestic_building">domestic

                                    material.</p></li></ul></div><p>Where a material standard for a doorset is not available, it should be
                        designed and constructed in accordance with the recommendations in Annex A
                        of BS 8220-1: 2000, together with the following recommendations, to ensure a
                        robust basic standard of security.</p><p>If single swing the doorset should be fitted with at least one and a half
                        pairs of hinges meeting the recommendations of BS EN 1935: 2002 for hinge
                        grade 11 or above. Hinges fitted to an outward-opening door should be of a
                        type that does not permit the hinge pin to be removed unless the door is
                        open. Otherwise, hinge bolts should be fitted to ensure the door leaf will
                        remain secure when closed.</p><p>A doorset should include a single-point locking device to BS 3621: 2007
                        (for keyed egress) or to BS 8621: 2007 (for keyless egress) or a multipoint
                        locking system. A deadlocking facility should be provided. Any lock cylinder
                        should be in accordance with BS EN 1303: 2005, grade 5 key security and
                        grade 2 attack resistance as a minimum.</p><p>To limit unauthorised access, a communal entrance door fitted with an
                        access control system (see clause 4.6.3) should be self-closing and
                        self-locking, with keyless operation of any lock from within the common
                        area. To accommodate access control systems, a doorset may incorporate
                        electronic or magnetic remote release and a means of access which includes
                        keyless electronic solutions (keypad, proximity swipe, etc).</p><p>Access to door locks from outside by breaking of glazing, in or adjacent
                        to a door leaf should be prevented by use of laminated glass or a similarly
                        robust glazing material.</p><p>A sliding door should have a multi-point deadlocking system with 3 or more
                        hook or similar bolts. To prevent removal of the door, an anti-lift device
                        should be fitted. Shoot bolts, if used, should locate into the head of the
                        frame.</p><p>A doorset with more than one door leaf should include a means of securing
                        any secondary leaf at head and foot to allow the primary leaf to be securely
                        locked.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e14920"></a>4.13.5 Installation and fixing of doors and windows</h3></div></div></div><p>Inadequate fixing into the surrounding structure will significantly affect
